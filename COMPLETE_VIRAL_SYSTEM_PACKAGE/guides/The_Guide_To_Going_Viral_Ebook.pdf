INTRODUCTION
GOING VIRAL IS NOT A MERE
STROKE OF LUCK; IT’S A
SCIENCE
In a world where more than 4,800,000,000 content creators churn out
billions of pieces of content daily, the competition for recognition is erce. In
this landscape, where social media reigns supreme and every brand and
individual vies for attention alongside the likes of Kim Kardashian, MrBeast,
Gary Vee, Cristiano Ronaldo, Jimmy Fallon, and teenage inuencers, how can
you rise above the noise and win the battle for attention?
Well, welcome to the world of content virality, where luck takes a back seat
and science takes the wheel. Since 2005, I’ve been on a mission to unravel the
mystery behind making content go viral for the largest brands, celebrities, and
individuals worldwide. In 2007, I pioneered the rst-ever inuencer campaign
on YouTube, setting the stage for groundbreaking strategies to come. Over the
years, I’ve overseen $200 million in marketing spend and have collaborated
with major corporations such as MTV, Viacom, Vice Magazine, Paramount
Pictures, Ikea, and Skechers shoes. My expertise extends to building digital
platforms for renowned gures like Taylor Swift, Rihanna, and Adriana Lima.
Additionally, I am the founder of the social media agency Hook Point. Some
of you may also recognize me as the author of the internationally bestselling
books One Million Followers: How I Built a Massive Social Audience in 30 Days
and Hook Point: How to Stand Out in a 3-Second World.

Before we dive into the powerful tools I’ve developed during my career,
let’s address some common myths about social media. Many people enter this
competitive arena with misconceptions that obscure a clear understanding of
what it truly takes to succeed.
TOP SEVEN SOCIAL MEDIA MYTHS DEBUNKED
Many people hold certain beliefs about social media that lean more toward
myth than reality. When I rst start working with a client and debunk the top
seven social media myths, they often nd some of these truths surprising. is
section aims to clear up the most common misconceptions, oering insights
that could challenge your current understanding of social media. Ready to
uncover the truth? Let’s dive in.
Myth 1: Extensive Experience Is Necessary for Social Media
Success
Does success on social media really require years of digital expertise? Discover
how newcomers can also achieve viral success with the right strategies.
Common Belief: e prevailing view is that only those with a wealth of digital
experience can achieve social media success, potentially sidelining those new to
the eld.
e Reality: In reality, eective strategies and adaptability are more crucial than
extensive experience. e Viral Content Model, which you will learn in this
book, demonstrates that success is accessible even to novices who are willing to
learn and apply its principles.
Behind the Myth: Intimidation from witnessing experienced inuencers’
success can be disheartening for beginners. However, social media is constantly
evolving, oering opportunities for new creators to succeed with fresh and
innovative content.

Success Stories: Examples such as leatherworker Tanner Leatherstein, with 1.7
million followers across TikTok and Instagram; and hand surgeon Dr. Erin
Nance, with 700,000 followers on TikTok, both started with minimal social
media experience and achieved signicant success, challenge the notion that
extensive experience is required. Everyone begins with zero followers and zero
views when they rst join these platforms. I started at this level too, which is
one of the reasons I’ve spent the past 19 years developing the learning
presented in this book—to help people succeed. Even MrBeast, the top
inuencer in the world, began his journey alone in a bedroom at the age of
13. At Hook Point, we often nd that working with marketing experts who
have years of experience can be challenging because there’s a lot of unlearning
that must be done. ey must move away from outdated methods and tactics
that are no longer relevant for success on social media.
Key Insights: Success on social media is driven by the ability to engage and
connect with an audience through compelling content, not the duration of
one’s experience. e Viral Content Model emphasizes strategic storytelling
and audience interaction.
Actionable Strategies: Adopt the Viral Content Model to produce content that
resonates with your audience, focusing on strategic learning and adapting
based on platform insights and audience feedback. is book will guide you
through these steps, regardless of your experience level.
Myth 2: Success on Social Media Requires High Costs and
Large Teams
Is the secret to viral success on social media really tied to how much you spend
and the size of your team? Let’s unpack this myth and discover what truly
drives content to go viral.

Common Belief: ere’s a widespread belief that achieving viral success on social
media necessitates signicant investment in high-end equipment and large
production teams.
e Reality: In truth, the essence of viral success on social media lies more in
the power of storytelling and audience connection than in the scale of
resources. Viral hits have often been created with minimal equipment, such as
smartphones, and without the support of a large team.
Behind the Myth: is misconception persists due to people’s familiarity with
well-produced TV shows and lms. Despite having seen tons of viral content
on social media that feature modest production value, many still mistakenly
associate high production values with social media success. In reality, a lot of
viral content has been created with nothing more than a smartphone. e
essence of virality lies in the content’s ability to connect and engage, not in the
polish of its production.
Success Stories: Content creators like Hunter Prosper, with 8.3 million
followers across Instagram and TikTok, who approaches strangers on the street
with just an iPhone; and Robert Croak, with 1.1 million followers on TikTok,
who lms walking listicles (i.e., walking down the street while listing advice),
are great examples of how simple, genuine interactions can captivate millions.
Along with others who use minimal setups, such as e School of Hard
Knocks, with 1.9 million followers on Instagram, that interviews people on
the street with a basic microphone. ese creators demonstrate that impactful
content does not require hefty budgets or big teams. Many Viral Formats that
you’ll learn about in this book thrive on the simplicity achievable with just a
smartphone and genuine human interaction.
Key Insights: e true drivers of social media virality are engaging narratives
and authentic connections, not high costs or large teams. Modern audiences
value great storytelling, which can be delivered without a hefty price tag or a

big team. Social media algorithms favor content that holds viewers’ attention
through relatable narratives, emotional connection, and genuine engagement
over slick production.
Actionable Strategies: Focus on harnessing the storytelling potential within your
reach. Utilize the technology at your disposal, such as smartphones, and
aordable editing tools to craft content that resonates. is book guides you
through creating impactful content without reliance on expensive equipment,
emphasizing storytelling and communication techniques that foster genuine
engagement over production value.
Myth 3: You Must Be on Every Social Media Platform
Is being active on every social media platform the key to social media success?
Let’s explore why a more focused approach might be more eective.
Common Belief: Many believe that to maximize their online presence and
engagement, brands or individuals must maintain active proles across all
available social media platforms. is belief is rooted in the assumption that
being everywhere at once is the key to digital marketing success.
e Reality: e belief that spreading oneself across every social media platform
guarantees greater success is a misconception. Each platform is uniquely
designed, with distinct content formats, user interfaces, and engagement
behaviors. While many people use multiple platforms, they consume content
dierently on each due to these design elements, which is why the eectiveness
of your social media presence depends more on how well you tailor your
storytelling to the specic consumption behaviors of each platform.
Behind the Myth: e persistence of this myth is likely inuenced by the visible
presence of major brands and celebrities on multiple platforms. is
widespread visibility reinforces the “more equals better” commonsense
approach, where more frequent exposure is often mistaken for greater

eectiveness. is strategy, often reiterated by some social media experts, may
have found success in the earliest days of social media, when there was less
content and fewer creators on the platforms, making it easier to gain traction
by simply posting more.
Success Stories: Numerous brands and individuals have achieved remarkable
success by focusing their eorts on a single or a limited number of platforms.
For example, MrBeast, who has 260 million subscribers on YouTube
compared to 18 million on Facebook, initially focused solely on
YouTube. He mastered its nuances before expanding to other major
platforms.
Another example is Joe Rogan, who initially focused all his energy
on YouTube. His success on this platform made him the world’s
most prominent podcast host, leading to a lucrative $100 million
deal with Spotify in 2020. Recently, Spotify renewed its partnership
with Rogan under a new multiyear contract potentially worth as
much as $250 million, which also includes provisions for his show
to appear on competing platforms like YouTube and Apple Podcasts.
Despite this expansion, Rogan rarely shares clips on Instagram and
does not maintain active TikTok, LinkedIn, or Facebook accounts
for his podcast.
By focusing on platforms that best suit their content style, creators emphasize
the value of depth over range in their social media strategy.
Key Insights: Spreading resources too thin across multiple platforms can lead to
diminished content quality and thus audience engagement. Success in social
media marketing comes from understanding the unique characteristics of each

platform and creating tailored content that resonates with the specic design
and consumption behaviors of the platform.
Actionable Strategies: Instead of trying to maintain an active presence on every
platform, choose one that you enjoy working on, which reects your content
style. Invest time in understanding the nuances of this platform, and tailor
your content strategy to leverage its specic features and audience behavior.
While it’s ne to post content on other platforms, focus your primary eorts
on mastering one.
Myth 4: Frequent Posting Guarantees Social Media Virality
Can posting content frequently guarantee viral success? Uncover the truth
behind content frequency and audience engagement on social media.
Common Belief: ere’s a common misconception that the key to going viral
on social media is to post as frequently as possible.
e Reality: Virality on social media doesn’t depend on posting frequency, but
rather on the quality of content and how deeply it holds the audience’s
attention.
Behind the Myth: e myth arises from the mistaken belief that social media
algorithms prioritize quantity over engagement. While this might have been
somewhat true in the early days of social media when there were fewer content
creators and less content, the landscape has changed dramatically. Today, with
billions of content creators and an overwhelming amount of content for the
algorithms to select from, merely posting frequently without focus on quality
is ineective. Only once you’ve mastered a Viral Format that works for you—
which you will learn about in this book—should you consider increasing your
posting frequency.
Success Stories: Creators who achieve viral success often do so with infrequent,
yet highly engaging content. is approach emphasizes strategic, impactful

posts over a haphazard approach to content creation. For example, Mark
Rober typically posts a video once or twice a month; MrBeast, in his early
days, would post only one video a month; and Veritasium limits its output to
two to three videos per month on YouTube.
Key Insights:
Algorithm preferences: Contrary to the myth, social media
algorithms favor retention and interaction, focusing on viewer
engagement duration rather than posting frequency. It’s the quality
of storytelling that captures and holds attention, not the frequency
of posts.
Quality engagement: e most successful viral content resonates
deeply with audiences through well-crafted storytelling, rather than
sheer volume of posts.
Actionable Strategies: Shift your content strategy focus from quantity to
quality. Concentrate on creating content that genuinely engages and resonates
with the masses. Use storytelling techniques and Viral Formats to enhance
engagement and viewer retention.
Myth 5: My Business Isn’t Sexy Enough to Go Viral
ink your industry is too niche to go viral? Let’s challenge the idea that only
“sexy” businesses can capture the viral spotlight.
Common Belief: Many entrepreneurs think that their businesses, especially in
elds like tax accounting, legal advice, or other specialized areas, lack the
general appeal necessary for viral success on social media. ey often view
these industries as too niche or “unsexy” to attract widespread attention.
e Reality: e idea that only glamorous or inherently exciting industries can
achieve virality is a misconception. Viral success often relies more on how

content connects and resonates with the audience than on the industry’s
surface appeal.
Behind the Myth: is myth persists due to the underestimation of storytelling
power and the disbelief that any topic can resonate emotionally with the
masses. ere’s a common misconception that the nature of an industry could
limit its widespread appeal.
Success Stories: Examples debunking this myth include:
Clear Value Tax, which has two million subscribers, oers insightful
tax advice on YouTube.
Graham Stephan, a nance adviser with 4.7 million subscribers,
shares nancial tips for millennials on YouTube.
Erika Kuhlberg, a legal expert with a combined 14 million
followers, simplies legal concepts on TikTok and Instagram.
Ben Newell, who has 1.5 million followers, builds terrariums—a
type of miniature ecosystem in sealed containers—for plants and
small land animals like frogs, ants, and turtles.
ese examples show that perceived “unsexy” topics can capture and engage a
vast audience.
Key Insights: Viral success often comes from creating compelling stories that
build tension and curiosity, which creates a narrative gap that keeps viewers
engaged until the resolution. is approach holds attention eectively,
regardless of the industry’s perceived appeal.
Actionable Strategies: To achieve similar success, use the “generalist principle”
by considering how you can weave a story around your niche that engages
viewers until the end. If you’re unsure how to use the generalist principle and
craft compelling narratives within your niche, you’ve come to the right place.

is book will teach you exactly that. Continue reading to discover Viral
Formats that will help you structure your stories in extraordinary ways.
Myth 6: Hashtags Guarantee Visibility
Are hashtags really the magic bullet for getting noticed on social media? Let’s
discuss how the role of hashtags has evolved in the algorithm era.
Common Belief: Popular hashtags are often seen as a magic bullet for ensuring
that posts get seen on social media.
e Reality: Hashtags have lost much of their power to boost visibility due to
the evolution of social media algorithms, which now prioritize retention and
engagement.
Behind the Myth: Once a tool for standing out, hashtags are now less eective
amid the current volume of content on social media platforms.
Key Insights: Social media platforms are designed to highlight content that
captures and retains attention, not just posts with trending hashtags.
Actionable Strategies: Content creators should focus on the quality of their
narratives and the resonance of their posts, rather than using hashtags as a
primary strategy.
Myth 7: Virality on Social Media Is Pure Luck
Is going viral on social media just a matter of luck? Let’s break down the
strategic planning that truly drives virality, dispelling myths of randomness.
Common Belief: Many believe that achieving virality on social media is akin to
winning the lottery—a matter of sheer luck rather than strategic planning.
e Reality: Contrary to this common perception, virality is most often the
result of meticulous research, planning, and a deep understanding of
storytelling and audience engagement, making it more of a science than a
game of chance. A detailed examination of viral content often shows

intentional design and strategic execution, demonstrating that virality can be
systematically planned and replicated with the right storytelling tools.
Behind the Myth: e myth likely stems from the sensational stories of
overnight success and the emergence of individuals who defy the conventional
image of fame, such as MrBeast. ese creators, who dier from the traditional
lm and TV stars, may give the impression of attaining virality by mere luck,
which reinforces this misconception. Yet, the experiences of creators like
MrBeast illustrate that such success is far from random. It is the culmination of
a deliberate process and extensive learning about the intricacies of crafting a
truly viral video. e Viral Content Model detailed in this book unveils the
structured approaches behind achieving widespread recognition, challenging
the notion that virality is unpredictable and random.
Key Insights: Virality follows principles that can be learned and applied. It
involves understanding social media user behavior, leveraging data to inform
content creation, and developing narratives that captivate and retain viewer
attention.

Actionable Strategies: Rather than attributing social media success to luck,
adopt strategic models and tools to signicantly increase your content’s viral
potential. e Viral Content Model outlined in this book serves as a
comprehensive guide to achieving planned virality. By focusing on storytelling
and communication techniques, you can produce content that resonates with
the masses and achieves viral success.
INTRODUCING THE VIRAL CONTENT MODEL
Now that we’ve dispelled some common misconceptions, let me introduce
what I’ve discovered actually works—the Viral Content Model. is model
was developed at my social media agency, Hook Point, based on years of
meticulous research and practical application. Designed to master the art of
virality on social media, this model has already generated tens of billions of
views and secured over 100-plus million followers. Our consistent and
impactful strategies have established us as leaders in the industry.
As I explained in the nal myth, one of the most powerful truths that has
emerged from my years of research and experience is that creating viral
content is not a mere stroke of luck; it’s a science. And in this book, I’m
thrilled to share that science with you. Together, we’ll delve into the inner
workings of social media algorithms, learn how to craft content that the
algorithms love, and uncover simple yet eective strategies to achieve
consistent virality using the revolutionary tools developed by my team: the
Hook Point Viral Content Model, Viral Formats, and the Communication
Algorithm.

media algorithms function, making it eective across all social media platforms

expanding your reach.
Imagine your content not just reaching a few thousand, but tens or
hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of people. e impact on your
brand’s success and bottom line would be extraordinary.
In this book, you’ll master the innovative tools mentioned above. By doing
so, you’ll maximize your investment of time, money, and energy, fueling the
growth of your brand and business and increasing your market share.
To achieve maximum results with the algorithms, focus on three core
pillars:
1. Grabbing attention. Rising above the noise is crucial. If you can’t
stop someone from scrolling past your content, they’ll never see
your message.
2. Holding attention. Providing maximum value to your audience
is key. is isn’t about clickbait or trickery. Substance is vital, as
you want people to engage with and crave more of your content.
3. Monetizing attention. Your content strategy needs to align with
your business goals and objectives. A thoughtful and strategic
approach not only fuels business growth, ensuring that the
investment of time, money, and resources pays o but also helps
avoid creator fatigue and burnout.
roughout this book, you’ll discover how to break away from outdated
methods and deprogram your thinking about media and content. By adopting
the proven methods shared within these pages, brands and content creators
can start producing innovative and eective content that genuinely resonates
with audiences. is approach to viral marketing at scale isn’t about resorting

audience preferences can pave the way for consistent and predictable virality,
setting individuals and brands on the path to success in an otherwise
challenging and ever-changing social media landscape. Importantly, regardless

Mindset: Keep an Open Mind—Deprogram and Adopt a
Counterintuitive Perspective
“Hook Point’s method is a true revelation! As an Emmy Award–winning radio and
TV host, I thought I knew all there was to captivate an audience. But after
attending their training sessions, I realized that everything I previously thought
about social media marketing was wrong. It’s like being introduced to music modes
such as Dorian, Phrygian, or Locrian. Suddenly, you see the direct path that opens
your eyes, and you realize you just need to focus on this one thing and everything
becomes so much simpler! at’s exactly what Hook Point’s model did for me—it
transformed the way I connect with my audience, and now, I can’t imagine going
back to my old ways. It’s a game-changer!”
—JOHN TESH, EMMY AWARD–WINNING RADIO AND TV HOST
As we delve into the truth of viral content creation, let me be candid with
you. Much of what you’ve been told about using hashtags, content calendars,
posting times, and following trends has been a waste of time. Many so-called
social media gurus aren’t actually experts, and their advice usually doesn’t lead
to the desired outcomes they tout. e reality is, creating consistent viral
content demands dedication and hard work, much like mastering any skill in

life. Although the approach you’ll learn in this book may be nuanced, it has
the potential to revolutionize your brand or business when you wholeheartedly
invest in the process.
To help you stay the course, I encourage you to remember why you chose
to read this book in the rst place. Learning how to captivate audiences about
your brand or business is invaluable. Social media is a powerful space where
you and countless others spend signicant time each week. Posting there has
the potential to draw millions of eyes to your content, impacting your business
and life profoundly. erefore, it’s crucial to approach this book with a
beginner’s mind—as a willing student absorbing information from moment to
moment.

Tanner Leatherstein attracted an impressive 1.7 million followers and 100
million organic views across TikTok and Instagram, and sold out of his goods.
Applying this model to Katie Couric’s content while she was at Yahoo! led to
over one billion views. As for comedian Stuart Mitchell, after a year of using
this method to nd success on social media, he has consistently generated
videos with over one million views, signicantly impacting his ticket sales and
even propelling his career down unexpected and exciting new paths.
ese clients improved their performance and experienced life-changing
results because they put in the work and spent time honing their craft.
Creators like MrBeast even say that even after his rst three years of fully
dedicated time to creating videos they still needed improving: “I’m still
learning things every day; 10,000 hours is three years of 10 hours a day . . .

that’s not enough time to master something. After three years, my videos were
awful.”

If you shy away from doing the work, you won’t nd the success you
desire. It’s that simple. Just like mastering any skill in life, creating viral
content requires dedication.
Your success in implementing the knowledge from this book hinges on one
crucial factor: your openness and willingness to adapt your current process to
the simple, yet not easy, approach that I’m about to share with you. Again, this
method is entirely dierent from anything you’ve encountered before,
breaking away from traditional norms and preconceived notions about digital
success. However, if you embrace this process and commit to following the
guidance, the results will be well worth the eort.
Here are four principles that will help you adopt a learner’s mindset:
1. Capitalize on social media’s expansive reach. Recognize that
traditional specic audience targeting isn’t sucient for
consistently generating organic viral content. Instead, aim to craft
content that appeals to a wider audience. Take a cue from Gucci’s
strategic pivot: they expanded beyond their niche of high-end
consumers to market luxury streetwear on social media, amassing
a vast new customer base, which increased sales by 45 percent in
one year.
2 
It’s also crucial to remember that algorithms prioritize
maximizing viewer retention and engagement. To align with this
approach, identify viral content, study its allure, and weave
compelling elements into your own content.
2. Invest in the process, and embrace the learning curve. Allow
sucient time and energy to study the platform you want to
grow on, and rene your content creation skills. Recognize that
signicant results may take months or longer to materialize.

3. Stay committed and persistent, even when immediate success
feels elusive. Trust the process and continue putting in the work.
4. Realize that each piece of content on social media tells a story.
Develop the craft of storytelling to captivate your audience and
maintain their engagement with each post. By mastering this
method, your content will not only capture hearts but will also
get the algorithms working in your favor.
roughout this process, I’ll help you break free from traditional thinking
and deprogram the way you view media and content. By embracing change
and adopting a fresh perspective on social media, you can unlock the science
of virality and potentially transform your brand or business.
If you’re ready to challenge your preconceptions, embrace this new
approach, and put in the work, then this book is for you. I hope to see one of
your videos in my feed, amazing the world with your brilliance. Let’s embark
on this journey together and create something extraordinary!

PART I
THE HOOK POINT VIRAL
CONTENT MODEL

CHAPTER 1
DECODING VIRALITY: THE
SCIENCE BEHIND SOCIAL
MEDIA SUCCESS

Social media is both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing because it
democratizes communication, enabling anyone to pull out their phone,
record, and share content globally. However, it becomes a curse when it allows
creators to bypass the meticulous learning and strategic approach typically
required in lm production, music composition, television, and book writing.
As a result, social media often features content that lacks the structured
storytelling essential for viral success, leaving creators puzzled about why their
content goes unnoticed.
To address this challenge, this book primarily focuses on social media video
creation, although the Viral Content Model, Viral Formats, and the
Communication Algorithm you’ll learn about here can be applied to any type
of social media content. We emphasize video because it generally performs
better with the social media algorithms due to its higher retention rate
compared to other formats. In other words, videos typically keep viewers
engaged in ways that photos and text simply cannot match, increasing both
engagement and the time spent on the platform, which are key goals for social
media companies.
Building on this foundation, this book will teach you the Viral Content
Model, a creative process designed to perfect storytelling on social media and
achieve genuine success. At the heart of this model is the use of “formats”—
video storytelling frameworks that enable creators to strategically incorporate
their brands, identities, stories, or ideas. ese structured templates provide a
consistent narrative backbone, giving content the best chance to break
through and connect with the masses. Top formats act as exible canvases,
allowing for the sharing of unique messages and creativity, akin to the three-act
structure in lm, the verse-chorus format in music, teasers and tags in TV, or

the Hero’s Journey in literature. Every industry relies on a proven formula to
structure and enhance creative output.
Understanding the dierence between eeting social media trends and
enduring formats is crucial. Trends may capture attention temporarily, but
formats provide a lasting blueprint for content creation. Recognizing and
applying these formats is essential to enhancing your online presence and
achieving lasting impact.
At Hook Point, we’ve noticed many content creators chasing virality
without a proper understanding of formats or misusing them due to a lack of
subtlety in their approach. is is because there are numerous formats
available, some tailored to specic platforms, so you need to learn how to
recognize and leverage these formats for success. Learning the intricacies of
formats is as critical for creating impactful social media videos as it is for
producing a great lm. Fortunately, my team excels at identifying eective
formats that captivate the masses. We’ve devoted thousands of hours to
analyzing billions of views and tens of thousands of videos on social media,
uncovering and breaking down the nuances of these formats—insights we
share in this book. Our goal is to underline the critical role of formats in
creating impactful content and to oer a new lens through which to view
social media storytelling.
Just as a recipe or a blueprint is indispensable in cooking and construction,
formats act as essential blueprints for content creation, ensuring that they
capture the audience’s attention. For instance, the “Two Characters, One
Lightbulb” format eectively debunks misconceptions, demonstrated by “Are
You Eating Puppy Portions?” by @EmilyHackettFitness, which attracted over
seven million views. In this video, Hackett entertainingly debunks the myth
that counting calories is necessary for weight loss. is example illustrates how

a format can transform common content into something both enlightening
and shareable.
roughout this book, I’ll be referencing many videos and documents. If
you’d like to enhance your learning experience and get a clear visualization of
the topics discussed, you can view all video links and resources here:
http://guide.hookpoint.com/.
In Part II of this book, we’ll delve deeper into formats. For now, start
recognizing them in your feed. Properly applying these formats can transform
your content, propelling it toward virality. Success, however, demands more
than mere recognition. Ninety-nine percent of those who attempt to use a
format without proper research and implementation might fail. But those who
diligently apply the Viral Content Model and utilize Viral Formats can nearly
guarantee their success.
Beyond Industry Borders: The Generalist Approach to Capturing
Attention on Social Media
To stand out amid the noise and capture attention, you need to adopt a
generalist approach. By “generalist approach,” I mean that many companies
and brands often make the mistake of solely focusing on competing with their
direct industry rivals. But on social media, it’s crucial to remember that you’re
not just competing with peers from your sector. You’re in a virtual arena where
a personal nance company is not only up against other nancial rms but
also faces competition from every baking tutorial, beauty tip, travel vlog, and
DIY enthusiast out there. It’s not just about who oers similar services or
products—it’s about who can capture the audience’s limited attention span. To
stand out, you must think outside the box; it’s essential to ground your
content in broader interests, crafting content hooks and narratives that
resonate with a wider audience, all while maintaining authenticity and insight
with your core audience.

An excellent example of this generalist approach is Graham Stephan’s
YouTube channel, which is geared toward teaching millennials about nance.
Instead of producing a technical video on car nancing—a topic that might
only resonate with nance enthusiasts—he widened his reach with the
enticingly titled video How I Bought a Tesla for $78 Per Month. is clever
framing appealed not just to nance bus but also to anyone intrigued by
snagging a great deal, owning a Tesla, or simply discovering how he managed
to achieve it. It’s this type of creative repackaging—combining niche expertise
with widespread interests—that allows content to shine in the crowded arena
of social media, transforming what might garner 1,000 views into a sensation
with more than 8.5 million.
Imagine this scenario: You open a social media app, and the algorithm is
tasked with determining the rst 15 posts you will see, drawn from a pool of
approximately 150,000 or more potential pieces of content. In this situation,
99 percent of the content from this pool has no chance of being seen, even if
the users follow you. Given this challenging environment, it’s not enough to
excel only within your specic category or vertical; you must outperform
content across all verticals. erefore, seeking inspiration and innovation
beyond your immediate industry becomes not just benecial but crucial.
Algorithms: The AI Man, the Myth, and the Legend
ere are many myths surrounding algorithms. Frustrated content creators
often wonder if the algorithms are designed to suppress their content to force
them to use paid media for visibility. Let me debunk this myth right away: if
that were true, no content would ever go viral, and successful inuencers
wouldn’t exist without spending on ads.
So what do algorithms really do? ey’re engineered to prioritize content that
captures and sustains users’ attention for as long as possible. Social media
platforms are designed to keep users engaged on their platform for longer

durations so they can serve them as many ads as possible—maximizing user
retention is their primary business objective.
ink about it: the longer someone stays on a platform, the larger amount
of content they consume, providing more opportunities for ads to be shown.
Attention-grabbing content fuels these social media engines, and it’s our
collective eyeballs that determine what kind of fuel is fed into these platforms.
Without our attention, platforms can’t serve ads, and without great content,
we won’t stay engaged. erefore, creating content that the algorithms love
becomes the key to getting our content seen.
As a brand owner and content creator, your goal is to craft content that
not only grabs attention but also retains it longer than all the potential posts
the algorithm can serve up to your audience each time they open the app.
When you meet the algorithm’s standards, it will eagerly serve your content to
its users, amplifying its reach. You may not be able to defeat the algorithm, but
you can collaborate with it.
Drawing from extensive experience and testing, I’ve found that there’s only
one proven method to become an expert at creating algorithm-friendly content. It
involves researching top-performing content formats, carefully crafting
content based on that understanding, analyzing its performance, and rening
it accordingly.
Now, I don’t want you to just take my word for it. MrBeast, one of the
most successful content creators in the world, with more than 300 million
subscribers across his social media platforms, concurs with this method. When
asked how he learned to consistently create viral content, MrBeast shared:
Most of my growth came after I graduated high school. I somehow found these other
four lunatics. ree of us were college dropouts, one was a high school dropout. We were all
super small YouTubers, and we basically talked every day for a thousand days in a row and
did nothing but just hyper-study what makes a good video, what makes a good thumbnail,
how to go viral. We would call them daily “masterminds.” We’d just get on Skype every

morning and, some days, I’d get on Skype at 7am, and I’d be on until 10pm, and then I’d
wake up and do it again. We’d take a thousand thumbnails, and see if there was a correlation
between the brightness of the thumbnail and how many views it got, or videos that get over
10 million views, how often do they cut the camera angles? We were very religious about it.
So that’s where most of my knowledge came from. I surround myself with these lunatics, and
every day, we didn’t do anything. We had no life. We all had 10 to 20,000 subscribers when
we met, and by the time we stopped talking, we all had millions of subscribers. We all hit a
million subscribers within a month of each other, which is crazy.
3
As you can see, MrBeast and his fellow YouTubers dedicated themselves to
daily “masterminds” for more than a thousand days, obsessively analyzing what
makes videos go viral. eir relentless pursuit of knowledge and unwavering
commitment to understanding the intricacies of successful content creation
eventually led them to massive success. Such dedication and attention to detail
played a pivotal role in their journey to becoming viral sensations.
While not everyone may have the luxury of investing a thousand days in
exhaustive research, fear not. I feel your pain. At Hook Point, we’ve harnessed
our extensive experience and expertise to develop a creative model that
reverse-engineers virality across any social media platform. My goal is to
provide you with foundational elements of this model, ensuring that you
consistently stand out amid the noise and captivate your audience.
Winning Trust with Social Network Algorithms: A Comprehensive
Guide
In today’s digital world, algorithms govern the visibility and virality of
content. ese intricate systems, used by social media platforms, determine
what content is displayed in our feeds. Here’s an in-depth look at how these
algorithms function and how you can navigate them to achieve online success:
THE NATURE OF ALGORITHMS
Social media algorithms are designed with one primary goal: retaining
users on the platform for as long as possible. ink of an algorithm as a

cautious friend you’re trying to impress. A new friend will introduce you to
small groups of their friends initially. e algorithm does the same by exposing
your content to a select audience rst. If this initial audience resonates with
what you’ve shared, the algorithm broadens its reach.
SEEDING: AN ANALOGY
Imagine that you’re a gardener planting seeds. e growth of these seeds
hinges on factors such as soil quality and sunlight. Similarly, the “seeds” of your
content are rst “planted” among a smaller audience. If this group interacts
positively, indicating good “soil conditions,” the algorithm “plants” your
content among a larger audience, letting it grow and ourish.
THE GROWTH CURVE: FROM FEW TO MILLIONS
When well-known creators like MrBeast post content, the algorithm trusts
its appeal, given his track record, seeding it to millions immediately. But
newcomers shouldn’t get disheartened if their initial reach is limited. Creating
and sharing content that consistently engages viewers can gradually earn the
algorithm’s trust, widening the audience reach.
REBUILDING TRUST
Cookie-cutter content with low watch time will reduce visibility over time.
If your content doesn’t resonate with the initial viewers it’s been shown to, the
algorithm will stop sharing it. Yet, a dip in performance isn’t irreversible for
your account. By analyzing audience preferences and adapting—meaning
creating a new, better piece of content that has mass appeal—you can regain
algorithmic trust. Remember, these algorithms aim to optimize user
experience. Align your content with this goal, and trust will follow.
THE INTRICACIES OF VIRALITY

Many people believe that virality is a product of luck or a massive follower
count. However, the reality is more complex. A large number of followers
doesn’t guarantee heightened visibility or engagement in today’s digital world.
For instance, on platforms such as Instagram, research indicates that only
about 10 percent of followers might view a specic post.
4 
Numerous big
brands or inuencers, despite their vast followings, often experience a
mismatch between their follower count and actual engagement. eir brand’s
reputation propels their social presence; and due to their widespread
recognition, people follow. However, a high follower count doesn’t always
equate to high viewership and engagement.
On the other hand, social accounts by creators with fewer followers can
create content that fundamentally drives their business. eir expertise in
social media storytelling results in genuine engagement and a growing
customer base.
PAID GROWTH VS. ORGANIC VIRALITY
Organic virality arises when users genuinely engage with and share content.
Maintaining a steady organic reach can be challenging, which is why platforms
oer paid opportunities to seed your content to new people. But if the content
doesn’t have inherent appeal, even paid pushes can fall at. Crucially, paying
for promotion on a piece of content that doesn’t have the ability to generate
genuine engagement might even reduce organic reach in the future.
Nevertheless, once your content demonstrates organic success, paid
promotions can bolster its impact. For viral content that has reached a
standstill, paid promotions can reignite its spread, especially if that content is
generating leads or sales.
UNLOCKING VIRALITY: CRAFTING COMPELLING CONTENT
THROUGH RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS

e secret to virality lies in creating content that keeps viewers’ attention
on your content, a skill you’ll hone through the research and analysis
techniques detailed in this book. It’s essential that your content not only
captivates but also connects with a wide audience. e more time people spend
watching the entirety of your videos and actively engaging with your post via
likes, comments, and shares, the higher the likelihood that algorithms will
boost its reach.
Navigating the maze of social network algorithms is no easy task. At their
core, these algorithms prioritize consistent user satisfaction and experience. For
content creators and brands, this means creating content that incorporates
performance drivers and utilizes a compelling Viral Format.
Is the Business Driving Social Media, or Is Social Media Driving
the Business? Why You Shouldn’t Follow Apple’s Strategy
Many clients approach my team and me with the hope of emulating
content from popular businesses and celebrities. At face value, this appears to
be a solid strategy, but there’s more beneath the surface. Consider Apple:
although they have more than 31 million followers on Instagram, their videos
only average around two million views. On YouTube, where they boast 18.5
million subscribers, their videos gather between two and ve million views
each. However, it’s worth noting that many of Apple’s YouTube videos, such as
A Guided Tour of iPhone 15 & iPhone 15 Pro, with 31 million views, are
boosted with paid promotions. e evidence? It has only 68,000 likes. In
comparison, Mark Rober’s How to Escape a Police Sning Dog, with a similar
view count of 27 million, has 608,000 likes.
A general rule of thumb is that videos on YouTube should have at least 1
percent of their view count in likes. TikTok, on the other hand, typically sees a
higher ratio, with likes averaging between 5 and 10 percent of views. Although
Apple’s numbers may seem impressive, they’re quite modest given the brand’s

global prominence, especially when factoring in the paid media they put
behind their videos. For a brand of Apple’s caliber, these numbers are
surprisingly low.
Now, it’s tempting to attribute Apple’s and Amazon’s follower counts to
their content quality. However, that’s not the full story. eir global brand
recognition draws audiences to their social media platforms, not necessarily the
potency of their content. Understanding this nuance is important for anyone
using social media as a growth tool.
Also, companies such as Apple and Amazon invest billions in o-platform
advertising. For instance, Amazon’s 2022 advertising budget hit a record-
breaking $20.6 billion,
5 
while Apple allocated $1.8 billion in 2020.
6 
is
heavy investment undoubtedly impacts their social media traction.
e performance of major brands like Apple and Amazon underscores why
they aren’t good references for content creators to mimic. ese larger brands
often apply traditional creative strategies to social media, a platform that
demands a unique approach. To truly excel on these platforms, brands should
craft content specically tailored to them, instead of merely repurposing
conventional methods. One could argue that their content does little to boost
product sales or drive new subscribers. Instead, people gravitate toward these
pages out of product love, not content infatuation.
On the other hand, consider the fashion inuencer who calls herself
Bestdressed. Despite only having 3.7 million subscribers on YouTube, her
videos average well over two million views. On Instagram, with 1.5 million
followers, she averages around 100,000 likes—the metrics on both platforms
surpass Apple’s. is dierence highlights the necessity of discerning why
people follow a particular account. Evaluating views and interactions can
reveal if it’s the content, brand loyalty, or a blend of both that attracts
audiences.

Social Media Is a Science: Harnessing Data for Success
In the realm of science, progress is driven by centuries of iterative testing
(small, gradual changes or updates to a product based on insights), meticulous
data analysis, and accumulated knowledge. But in content creation, there’s a
tendency to discard the plethora of accessible data, choosing instead to chase
after pure originality.
Consider the process of developing a new drug: It’s not based on mere trial
and error or gut feelings. Instead, pharmaceutical companies follow the
scientic research process. ey thoroughly study existing medicines,
understanding which ingredients have been successful and which ones have
failed. en they use this knowledge to develop winning formulas.
In contrast, when developing content, many prioritize originality in
storytelling, believing it will drive their success. Although innovation is crucial,
overlooking the vast data bank available is a missed opportunity. But it’s not
just about numbers. A signicant portion of our research-driven model is
rooted in qualitative analysis—gathering, organizing, and interpreting
quantitative data to reveal elements that are driving performance in content.
Although striving for fresh ideas is commendable, many have explored similar
concepts—with varying outcomes. As such, we should treat past eorts as
valuable learning experiences. e core of our work together will involve
identifying content that genuinely resonates with the masses, as well as what
falls at. is qualitative, research-based insight will steer your content
creation, empowering your social media strategy with storytelling that
captivates the masses. In the digital age, data is invaluable, but understanding
the story behind the data is equally pivotal.
Target with the Generalist Principle: Go Beyond Your Core
Identifying a target audience is undeniably essential for any brand or
business. However, hyperfocusing on just that audience with your social media

content can limit your opportunities when aiming for consistent viral
breakthroughs. My goal is to guide you in crafting content with universal
appeal. is content can be packaged and framed in a way that resonates with
the masses yet retains a subtext and core message that engages and motivates
your target audience. Although this strategy may seem counterintuitive to
some marketers, it’s the most eective approach for consistently going viral on
social media. Although succeeding with niche messaging is possible, it can be
quite challenging and relies heavily on luck. As a primary strategy for organic
social media, I don’t recommend it.
As a marketer, your goal is not just to engage existing fans but also to
achieve continued growth and attract new fans and customers to your brand
or business. is means appealing to those who are already familiar with your
brand as well as to those who have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever. By
catering to both groups, you can maximize the reach and impact of your
content, signicantly increasing your chances of success.
Although you may have a target audience in mind, if you carefully examine
your current social media content, you’ll likely nd that the highest-
performing content doesn’t solely cater to that specic target audience. For
instance, let’s say your target audience is women aged 35 to 55. If you analyze
the highest-performing post that reaches that demographic, you’ll notice that
its success stems from appealing to the masses. e key is to create content that
can be enjoyed and valued by anyone, without losing the subtext that is important
to your core target audience. By producing content with a universal appeal, you
position yourself to not only capture and hold the attention of the masses but
also to prompt algorithms to share your content with people beyond your
existing followers. is amplication results in heightened engagement,
bolstered brand awareness, and ultimately, business expansion.

Neuroscience professor and lab director Andrew Huberman, PhD
(hubermanlab on Instagram), is an example of a creator with an extremely
niche subject matter, yet he has incredibly high-performing content that often
surpasses more than a million views. His success can be attributed to the fact
that he has engineered his content to have mass appeal—it can enhance and
improve anyone’s life—without watering down his expertise. By choosing
broad topics such as screentime or sunlight exposure, which hold relevance to
almost anyone, Huberman’s content garners signicant viewership.
Another prime example of the value of appealing to the masses is world-
famous podcast host Joe Rogan. If you look at some of his most successful
episodes, you’ll discover that they comprise interviews with individuals
discussing niche topics that typically involve specialized terminology and
jargon. One such episode is his conversation with Jimmy Corsetti, an
independent researcher behind the YouTube channel “Bright Insight,” which
explores ancient mysteries and lost civilizations. Although Corsetti might be a
recognized name among his fans, the average Rogan listener likely isn’t
familiar with him or his detailed investigations.
In their episode, they explore Corsetti’s theory of the Lost City of Atlantis
—a topic unfamiliar to many. Rogan takes the approach of assuming that his
audience has limited knowledge on the subject and provides an opportunity
for them to learn something new. Although Corsetti’s core audience would
undoubtedly enjoy the episode, Rogan ensures that it’s accessible to everyone.
His generalist approach, combined with his genuine curiosity, propelled this
episode to be viewed more than 10 million times on YouTube alone. By
adopting this inclusive mindset, Rogan successfully makes even the most
esoteric subjects accessible to a vast audience.
Going Viral vs. Converting

Some of you may already be familiar with my book Hook Point, in which I
explained that successful marketing at scale requires you to develop a strategy
to grab attention to stand out from the vast sea of content out there. en,
you need to hold that attention by having substance, so that people receive
value from your content. From there, you can maximize attention by
monetizing it eectively.
Although some argue that focusing solely on virality is not as crucial as
concentrating on conversion rates—such as generating sales or leads—it’s
essential to understand that the goal of the method presented in this book aims
to achieve both virality and increased sales. While achieving a 50 percent
conversion rate on a video with 1,000 views is impressive, this approach is
geared toward reaching hundreds of thousands to millions of views
consistently. At this scale, even a modest conversion rate can yield substantial
results, as the exposure to a larger audience increases awareness and potential
conversions. Furthermore, this expansive reach bolsters a robust retargeting
audience for your paid media eorts.
A practical example to support this approach comes from recent data
shared by TikTok. is video hosting service highlights the merits of an
“always engaged” approach, which combines organic and paid content while
engaging creators to help brands realize unique business objectives. is
holistic tactic empowers brands to be dynamic and involved on the platform,
fostering increased brand aection, recall, and resonance.
Consider these illuminating statistics from TikTok that emphasize the
potency of a combined organic and paid content approach:
e Power of platform-specic content creation: 79 percent of
TikTok users gravitate toward brands that exhibit prowess in
content creation specic to the platform, implying that integrating
content types showcases your brand’s prociency beyond just ad
campaigns.

Doubling up on ROAS (return on ad spend): When brands
combine organic activity with paid media on TikTok, they
experience a noticeable boost in their ROAS.
Inuential creators: One-third of TikTok users have been
persuaded to make purchases based on recommendations by
platform creators, suggesting the merit of collaboration with
creators alongside individual brand promotions.
Escalated brand awareness: Content diversity can supercharge
brand awareness, with TikTok recording a staggering 173 percent
uptick in brand top-of-mind awareness after two brand content
exposures.
Amplied brand anity: Post ad viewing, organic content sees a
20 percent spike in brand likability.
Boosted brand recall: Preceding an ad with organic content can
elevate brand recall by up to 27 percent.
Augmented brand relevance: After ad exposure, organic content
relevance surges by 18 percent, as per user feedback.
In essence, a balanced blend of organic and paid content on platforms such
as TikTok can supercharge your brand’s outcomes. e platform’s users are
noticeably more responsive to advertising when they perceive a brand’s
commitment to both organic and paid content creation.
7 
Additionally, the
insights gained from your analysis and research on organic social media can be
directly applied to your conversion strategies. Most people don’t realize that
their targeted advertisements need to compete with organic content in users’
feeds, just as organic content does.
Focus on Winning One Platform at a Time

My team and I like to categorize content into two primary types: short
form and long form. Short-form content usually ranges from 15 seconds to
three minutes and is primarily found on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok,
YouTube Shorts, and Facebook. In contrast, long-form content, which is
typically 20 minutes or longer (with some of the best content extending to
hours), is more prevalent on platforms like YouTube.
Prioritizing one platform at a time is key. By mastering content creation
on one platform—say, Instagram—you establish a foundation. From there,
branching out to other platforms becomes a logical next step. For those
focusing on short-form content, our advice is to zero in on one platform for
optimization and benchmarking, while also considering cross-posting onto
other platforms. To illustrate this concept, if your primary platform is
Instagram and you’ve tailored your content for it, this content can be
repurposed and shared on TikTok and YouTube Shorts. It’s essential to note
that results may vary across platforms, given the distinct consumption
behaviors inherent to each. Once you have a solid grasp of your primary
platform, you can explore adjustments for other platforms or even consider a
distinct content format tailored to each one.
Traditional Approaches to Content Creation Don’t Work: The
“Commonsense Model”

When it comes to content creation, 99 percent of brands follow what I call
the Commonsense Model. is widely adopted approach usually starts with
creating comprehensive brand guidelines, which comprise elements such as the
brand’s chosen colors, tone, mission statements, and more to establish the
brand’s identity. Once these guidelines are in place, they become the bedrock
upon which all content creation is based.
Following this approach, marketing teams begin brainstorming sessions for
their monthly or quarterly content plans. From there, they move into a
production phase, often producing content in batches. For instance, they
might curate a series of 20 videos, all meticulously scheduled for release at 9
a.m. EST on predetermined dates over the course of a quarter. Once the
designated month or quarter comes to an end, they review the results to assess
the performance and impact of the content they shared.
On the surface, this approach seems logical and well structured. However,
it often leads to repetitive and stagnant outcomes. e absence of data-driven
insights, regular experimentation, and a continual feedback mechanism means
that brands often produce content that fails to captivate or engage their
audience. is leads to sporadic success that appears more by accident than

design—without any sustained growth, improvement, or learning along the
way.
By failing to take the time for proper analysis, the Commonsense Model
forces marketers to rely on luck. When content underperforms, the initial
response is to assume that there’s a need for better ideas. But how do you rene
ideas if you don’t know where they faltered? Was the idea awed at its core, or
did the execution not do it justice? Was the video’s introduction lacking, or was
it the way the story was told? Without analyzing and learning from each
content piece, determining areas of improvement becomes a guessing game.
Instead of producing a bunch of videos all at once, it’s better to pace
yourself. A smarter creative model involves analyzing the performance of a
single video in depth, discerning its strengths and weaknesses, and harnessing
those insights to shape the next piece. Although this approach certainly slows
down the content production cycle, it encourages a culture of reection and
deliberate creation. It champions understanding audience preferences and
prioritizes the quality of content over mere volume.
Prioritizing quality in content creation is crucial, given that the algorithms
determining content visibility and popularity aren’t swayed by sheer quantity.
Instead, they favor user engagement and retention. e longer a viewer
watches and engages with your content, the better its performance. By
channeling resources—whether it’s time, money, or creative energy—into
crafting fewer but more impactful pieces, you not only foster better
engagement but also position your brand for sustained growth in the long run.
The Viral Content Model
To help you avoid relying on mere luck, allow me to introduce the Viral
Content Model, a systematic approach that saves you time, resources and
money:

UNDERSTANDING KEY TERMS
Before we dive into the steps in the Viral Content Model, it’s essential to
familiarize ourselves with some key terms:
Formats: ese are video storytelling structures that serve as
frameworks into which creators can strategically insert their brands,
identities, stories, or ideas. ese structures oer a consistent
narrative framework, guiding content presentation to resonate with
the masses. Top formats oer a versatile canvas for creators to insert
their messages and creativity.
Performance drivers: Elements in a video, or their combinations,
that specically inuence the performance of a video either upward
or downward. Only elements that have a clear impact on
performance are considered drivers.
Qualitative analysis: is involves gathering, organizing, and
interpreting quantitative data to reveal elements that are driving
performance in content. Some examples of performance drivers
that we discover through qualitative analysis include:

Communication Design: e arrangement of visual
and auditory elements of a video in a way that creates a
clear and eortless cognitive experience for the viewer.
Tension Building: Storytelling that compels the viewer
to know what happens next by indicating or creating a
problem, which in turn generates anticipation for a
resolution.
Contrast: e juxtaposition of two or more items that
can direct the viewer’s attention, create curiosity, or
support storytelling. On social media, contrast can be
found in the storyline, visuals, or delivery.
(We will go more in-depth into all these performance drivers
and more, later in the book.)
Storytelling elements: ese are techniques that creators use to craft
compelling narratives. On social media, these elements support
traditional story arcs comprising an introduction, conict, rising
action, climax, and resolution. Almost any tactic that supports
traditional storytelling can be adapted for use in social media
content. Storytelling elements often, but not always, serve as
performance drivers. For instance, techniques such as tension,
suspense, irony, humor, and subverting expectations can amplify
content impact.
Video nuances: ese refer to the intricate details of a video,
encompassing aspects such as lighting, script structure, story hooks,
composition, the attire of the creator, and much more. When
particular nuances consistently appear in top-performing videos but

are absent or rare in low-performing ones, they can be identied as
performance drivers.
Tactic: In content creation, every element that you can see and hear
—words, music, visuals, story structure—is considered a tactic.
EOV: e Eect on the Viewer (EOV) refers to the impact that a
tactic or tactics have on those viewing the video. It’s a performance
driver that focuses on intangible yet powerful experiences for the
audience. e content moves them emotionally through dramatic
storytelling, reversal of expectations, surprise, change of perspective,
or an overall “gut punch.” Some common examples include gaining
clarity, sparking curiosity, or feeling satised.
Hypothesis: In the realm of content analysis, a hypothesis proposes
that a specic content nuance—whether audio, temporal, visual, or
storytelling—has a positive or negative impact on a piece of
content’s overall performance. To validate a hypothesis, you must
compare top-performing (designated as “Gold”) content with low-
performing (“Bronze”) content, looking for consistent patterns. If a
specic content element predominantly appears in the Gold
content and is absent from Bronze content, the hypothesis stands
validated, conrming that the element in question enhances video
performance.
Gold content: is category represents the pinnacle of performance
within its format, outshining typical results. ink of this as the
standout, breakthrough viral content that garners exceptional
attention. To discern what contributes to its viral success, we
identify and analyze its performance drivers, contrasting them
against low (Bronze) and baseline (Silver) performers to spot
similarities and dierences in performance drivers among these

groups. Limiting our analysis solely to Gold content could
potentially exaggerate the importance of certain nuances.
Silver content: is tier signies the baseline number of views that a
creator (or creators within the same format) consistently achieves.
e number of views for Silver content approximates the value that
appears most frequently within our content sample. (In statistics,
this most common value is also called the “mode.”) We use this
mode value rather than the mean number of views to dene Silver
content because extremely viral or poorly performing videos could
skew the mean, leading to misclassication.
Bronze content: is category denotes content that falls below a
creator’s or format’s median view count. In comparison to their
baseline and breakthrough content, the view count for Bronze
content would be disappointing for the creator.
at’s a lot of information, so here’s a condensed list of key terms for your
reference:
Formats: Frameworks guiding content presentation to engage the
masses.
Performance drivers: Elements inuencing a video’s upward or
downward performance in terms of views, watch time, and
engagement.
Qualitative analysis: Gathering, organizing, and interpreting
quantitative data to reveal elements that are driving performance in
content.
Storytelling elements: Techniques supporting traditional story arcs,
such as tension or humor, enhancing content impact. ese are

often found to be performance drivers.
Video nuances: Details such as lighting, attire, script, and so on,
inuencing video performance.
Hypothesis: Proposes specic content nuances aecting a video’s
performance.
Gold content: is category represents the pinnacle of performance
within its format, outshining typical results.
Silver content: is tier signies the baseline number of views that a
creator (or creators within the same format) consistently achieves.
Bronze content: is category denotes content that falls below a
creator’s or format’s median view count.
It’s crucial to remember that our assumptions about content, formats, and
their performance should be treated as hypotheses and not facts. A common
misconception is thinking that content featuring cute puppies will
automatically go viral. is oversimplication halts deeper analysis, often
leading to underwhelming content performance. If the mere presence of cute
puppies were the recipe for virality, every puppy video would be a viral hit.
is is where the iceberg analogy comes into play: most only witness the top 1
percent of cute puppy videos going viral, missing the 99 percent below the
surface that don’t make the same impact.
Steps in the Viral Content Model

1. Research: Starting with preliminary research, we aim to
understand the nuances of the social media landscape and spot
creators and format directions that hold signicant potential and
have proven to consistently go viral.
2. Creative and data-driven format selection and analysis: Based
on our research, we rst select a format that shows the potential
for success. en, we delve deeper into the top (Gold), average
(Silver), and bottom-tier (Bronze) performers within that format.
For example, contrasting videos with two million views against
those that have 10,000 in the same format reveals the key
distinctions for their varying performances.
rough a comprehensive analysis of numerous videos, we begin to
identify consistent patterns. ese patterns serve as the foundation for
developing hypotheses about the essential elements that can propel a
video to viral status within a particular format. ey also highlight
elements to steer clear of. With this knowledge in hand, we transition
to the ideation (coming up with ideas) phase.

3. Highly informed, data-driven ideation: Here, we generate
around 20 potential content ideas, based on the format we’ve
identied and informed by what we’ve discerned about
performance drivers within that format. From this pool of ideas,
we carefully choose the one with the most potential based on our
assessments.
A standout advantage of our approach is our method of prioritizing
and ranking ideas. We’ve established a structured scale of 1 to 5, where
1 represents the strongest ideas with the most possible chance for
virality, and 5 represents those ideas with less potential. Our guiding
principle leans on qualitative data (elements that are driving
performance in content) and rigorous research, pushing aside personal
opinions and preferences. is allows for a more straightforward
evaluation of each idea’s potential for success. We will dive deeper into
the ideation process later in the book.
4. Single-iteration production planning: Also, instead of batch-
producing a large amount of content, a one-at-a-time approach is
adopted, primarily to test hypotheses eectively. e best idea
from a list is then selected, produced, and posted.
5. Reviewing results: e results are reviewed, and if the video goes
viral, fantastic! We can keep creating videos within that format as
long as we stick to the hypotheses that have been validated.
Moreover, it is easier to come up with new ideas using the same
approach because of the deliberate eort that lead to the success of
the initial post. If, on the other hand, a video doesn’t gain
traction, we must critically assess our execution. By comparing
our video with a top-performing (Gold) reference from our

research, we can determine if our video matches the standards set
by the successful reference. If our video does match those
standards yet still underperforms, it signals a need to revisit our
research and develop new hypotheses.
6. Reiterating the process with new insights: Every iteration oers
invaluable insights, furthering our learning and honing our
approach.
Our Philosophy: The Need for a Predictive Approach
Central to the Viral Content Model is vigorous research. We invest
signicant time in analyzing which storytelling formats are eective and why
they resonate. All creative ideas must be deeply rooted in research and
qualitative analysis. is is why my team and I consistently prioritize quality
over quantity. We steer clear of chasing eeting trends or sticking to arbitrary
posting schedules like “rowback ursday.” Instead, our focus is on critically
assessing the performance of each individual piece of content. By doing so, we
validate our understanding and application of insights gleaned from research.
is feedback is indispensable, directly informing the next piece of content we
work on, thereby perpetuating the cycle of research, analysis, and ideation.
The Viral Content Model vs. the Commonsense Model
e Viral Content Model stands in stark contrast to the Commonsense
Model introduced earlier in this chapter. e latter prells a month’s content
calendar in advance, leaving minimal opportunity to learn from and rene
each individual post. In this setup, content creation becomes a risky endeavor,
often resulting in a series of underperforming or even unsuccessful posts.
What makes matters worse is the lack of insight gained from these failures. On
the other hand, the Viral Content Model adopts a dynamic, research-oriented

approach emphasizing qualitative analysis, which leads to continual
improvement and a higher probability of viral success.
Branding and Its Impact on Performance
Another area where our approach diverges from the Commonsense Model
is in the integration of branding. We incorporate branding into our content
tactfully, and only after identifying the formats and qualitative nuances that
resonate with audiences on a large scale. Additionally, we rigorously assess how
the inclusion of branding elements inuences content performance.
Initially, our strategy leans toward creating content that’s minimally
branded to prioritize virality. After ensuring that the content can indeed
capture attention and go viral, we then integrate branding elements to
evaluate their impact on performance. For instance, if we can generate a
million views on a video using a specic format without a brand logo, and
then see a 75 percent drop in performance upon introducing that logo, it’s
clear that the logo is detrimental to engagement. Armed with this insight, we
then experiment with dierent methods of incorporating vital branding
elements in ways that don’t detract from performance.
Eect on the Viewer: Make People Care
In viral content creation, the primary goal is to discern what genuinely
captures and piques the interest of your audience. At Hook Point, we
emphasize the elements that profoundly aect and inuence the viewer. We
term this the EOV (Eect on the Viewer). e EOV represents the intangible
impact or feeling that viewers derive from content. For example, viewers
might be intrigued by the value promised in a video’s meme card (text caption
boxes that appear at the top or bottom of a video on Facebook, Instagram, or
TikTok).

However, the EOV should not be confused with a tactic—the
tangible method or tool employed in content execution. Tactics
include every element you can see and hear, such as words, music,
visuals, and story structure. Although these tactics lead to an eect
on the viewer, they are not the same thing. For instance, displaying
a meme card in a social media video is a tactic. e EOV resulting
from this tactic, on the other hand, can vary. Such text can evoke
feelings of intrigue, inspiration, confusion, challenge, indierence,
or reassurance in the viewer. Without understanding the intended
EOV, simply deploying a tactic might not achieve the desired
impact. Also, multiple tactics can be used to achieve the same EOV.
To excel in content creation, it’s important to align the tactics to achieve
the intended EOV. By doing so, creators ensure that the tangible elements of
their content (tactics) resonate with viewers in a meaningful and impactful way
(EOV). If, during your analysis of a format, all the top videos feature text on
the screen but you don’t consider the impact that this text has on the viewer,
then your observation of “text on the screen” becomes meaningless.
ere are various techniques for creating tension, and you can do an in-
depth analysis to discover them, but most brands don’t take the time. Instead,
they use primitive methods or fall into the copycat syndrome, where they see a
text box in a high-performing video and assume that it drove performance,
when it was actually the EOV of that tactic that created the impact. When
brands attempt to replicate the success of top creators, they often borrow
concepts from their videos; yet when their own video fails to generate the
expected traction, confusion arises. Many don’t realize that the success of top
creators comes from carefully studying and using storytelling methods that
deeply connect with their audience. It’s not solely the concept driving their
success; the nesse with which the idea is executed is equally as important.

When it comes to execution, you don’t need fancy strategies or complex
camerawork. What matters is understanding how your content will impact
your viewers—the emotions it evokes and the inspiration it provides.
Surprisingly, you can profoundly inspire and move your audience with subtle
tactics that have an immense eect.
For example, let’s look at creator Hunter Prosper, who has more than 6.3
million TikTok followers. He simply asks strangers on the street thought-
provoking questions, and his videos average a million-plus views each.
Prosper’s tactics are quite simple: he captures real people’s genuine responses to
thought-provoking questions such as “Who was your greatest love, and why
did you fall in love with this person?”
What’s fascinating is that his videos are technically straightforward, yet they
have an enormous impact. He only needs one camera (most likely an iPhone),
because Prosper doesn’t appear in his videos. rough trial and error, he
learned that his presence detracted from the power of others’ stories. When,
instead, he let the story and the responder take the spotlight, his videos’ success
skyrocketed.
Prosper also skillfully captures the audience’s attention right from the start
by beginning his videos with captivating moments that evoke strong emotions
in those he interviews. Whether it’s a gasp or a glimpse of nostalgia in their
eyes, these subtle yet powerful moments draw viewers in, leaving them craving
more. As you watch, you can sense the tension in the performance right away,
and you care about witnessing the outcome.
EXERCISE:
BEGIN THE PRELIMINARY RESEARCH PHASE
Now it’s your turn to embark on phase one of the research process! Dive
into social media platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram reels to

start observing content that’s gaining traction. As you explore, try to identify a
successful Viral Format. Remember, a format is dierent from a trend—
formats are reusable storytelling structures for content, while trends are often
eeting and subject to change. To pinpoint a successful format, visit the
creator’s account of the video that caught your interest. Check if they
consistently use that format and have at least ve to 10 videos using it with
high engagement rates. Take note of any specic elements that captivate your
interest and make you want to watch the videos till the end.
Next, explore content that isn’t performing well but uses the same
storytelling format. To nd low-performing content, delve into the prole of a
successful creator you come across. Assess their overall content performance
numbers, and nd videos that aren’t performing as strongly as their regular
posts.
By actively engaging with social media, over time you’ll gather real-time
information and gain a better understanding of what works and what doesn’t.
is hands-on approach will lay the groundwork for your ability to craft
content that resonates with audiences and has the potential to go viral.
CASE STUDY: CRAFTING VIRALITY:
HOW CRAFTSMAN TANNER LEATHERSTEIN TRANSFORMED INTO
A DIGITAL SENSATION
Introduction and Background: Tanner Leatherstein, an exceptionally
talented leather craftsman, faced the challenge of competing against established
luxury brands. Turning to Hook Point, his goal was clear: educate people
about quality crafted leather goods, and immerse them in an unforgettable
tactile experience.
Challenge: e task was to carve a niche for a smaller brand, making it a
compelling alternative to legacy luxury brands. Although Leatherstein and his

team were passionate, they had little experience in the vast landscape of social
media. Operating on a tight budget meant that they couldn’t invest heavily in
paid advertising, so they aimed for organic growth but didn’t know where to
begin.
Solution: Our team guided Leatherstein through a comprehensive approach
encompassing several key strategies:
1. e core of storytelling: We delved into the principles of
storytelling and authentic marketing, emphasizing the Viral
Content Model and the Communication Algorithm (which is
detailed in Part III of this book). Leatherstein learned how to
captivate vast audiences by leveraging broad psychological
patterns and communication styles.
2. Research and format selection: Together with Leatherstein, we
researched creative-content avenues and identied his core
storytelling format: “Is it Worth It?” Here, Leatherstein
deconstructs luxury leather goods, such as high-end Louis Vuitton
handbags, to determine their true worth in relation to their
market price.
3. Iterative content creation and testing: We familiarized
Leatherstein with the foundational elements of the Viral Content
Model. is encompassed guiding him on research techniques,
utilizing references, integrating the proper ideation process, and
emphasizing the importance of iterative testing throughout his
content development journey.
4. Generalist approach: To reach the masses, Leatherstein used a
“generalist” approach that extended beyond his usual
leatherworking niche. His innovative “Is it worth it?” format

proved to be a hit, sparking curiosity among a diverse group of
viewers. Even those with no prior interest in leather goods found
themselves engrossed in his videos, such as when he dissected a
Chanel handbag to evaluate its value. is strategy not only
intrigued a general audience but also appealed to potential
customers deeply invested in the world of leather goods. By
focusing on the universal appeal of quality and value,
Leatherstein’s content became a bridge between leather enthusiasts
and the public at large, creating narratives that were universally
engaging.
5. ASMR integration: Capitalizing on the intrigue of ASMR
(autonomous sensory meridian response)—referring to the
feeling people get in response to certain video and audio stimuli
—we advised Leatherstein to enhance the sensory experience of
leather crafting, catering to enthusiasts of both leather crafting
and ASMR.
6. Strong opening hooks: To ensure sustained viewer engagement,
we emphasized the importance of compelling video openings. By
suggesting that consumers might be overpaying for luxury brand
items, Leatherstein found that his content became widely
appealing.
Results: Leatherstein’s transition from oering niche leatherworking tips and
stale video ads showcasing his leather goods to deconstructing well-known
brands’ top products led to remarkable growth. is success was not a matter
of luck but the result of a deep understanding of storytelling, virality, and
human psychology. ere was a signicant increase in brand awareness, which
contributed to a dramatic increase in online sales. Visits to his company’s

website, PEGAI.com, soared from 10,000 to 100,000 visitors per month. is
exposure also led to features in prominent publications such as the New York
Times, the Financial Times, e Cut, Daily Mail, Yahoo! Sports, and the New
York Post. In addition, Leatherstein has gained a 1.7 million followers across
TikTok and Instagram, with an impressive 100 million organic views. e
venture has been so successful that he has established a new business to
capitalize on the extensive community he has built.
Conclusion: Leatherstein’s transformative journey from a novice in social
media to a viral sensation demonstrates that extensive prior experience isn’t a
prerequisite for success with this model. For businesses eager to augment brand
visibility and make a substantial impact, Leatherstein’s story provides
inspiration.

CHAPTER 2
THE RESEARCH REVOLUTION:
UNLOCK THE SECRETS TO
VIRAL CONTENT
Research is your ultimate superpower when it comes to crafting viral content.
Although it may seem time-consuming at rst, this approach actually saves a
ton of time in the long run. Imagine producing 100 videos with each
generating 10,000 views, compared to producing just one video that generates
a million views. Additionally, diving into research can be both enlightening
and enjoyable. As you begin discovering content that inspires you, and delve
into the reasons behind its allure, you’ll develop X-ray vision with respect to
the mechanics of content creation. is newfound understanding will grant
you the ability to shine brilliantly amid the sea of four billion other content
creators out there.
Your research isn’t merely about counting views, likes, or comments. While
quantitative data can tell us if a video was popular, it doesn’t reveal the deeper
story. is is where our qualitative approach shines. Rather than just asking
“How many?,” it delves into the “Why?” Why did a piece of content resonate?
What storytelling elements captured audiences’ attention? It gives us insights
into the underlying reasons for a piece of content’s success or lack thereof. In
this chapter, we’ll focus on these qualitative factors, equipping you with the
skills to unravel the narrative threads that weave the most engaging stories.
Incorporating Marginal Gains

Our approach reects that of the British cycling team’s use of marginal
gains, as highlighted in James Clear’s book Atomic Habits. Led by Sir Dave
Brailsford since 2003, British cycling has conducted exhaustive research to
rene every aspect of their performance. is includes enhancing training
regimens and dietary plans, improving the aerodynamics of equipment, and
boosting sleep quality for optimal recovery. e research and composition of
massage gels has also been rened to expedite muscle recuperation.
Furthermore, they investigated the use of customized bike seats tailored to
each rider’s physiology, which signicantly enhanced comfort and eciency
during races.
is research-rst methodology uncovered numerous opportunities for
minor yet signicant improvements. Implementing these insights led to
incremental, cumulative enhancements, catapulting British cycling from
underperformers to world leaders. eir success reveals the impact of
disciplined, research-driven strategies.
When integrated into a social media strategy, this principle of prioritizing
in-depth research followed by methodical testing and thoughtful application
can signicantly boost your digital presence. By adopting a comprehensive
research approach that encompasses an understanding of diverse formats and
the nuanced drivers of communication performance—both positive and
negative—you set yourself up for success in the competitive arena of social
media, aiming for your own “gold medal.”
Finding and Comparing Formats
Formats are video storytelling structures that serve as frameworks into
which creators can strategically insert their brands, identities, stories, or ideas.
ese structured templates oer a consistent narrative framework, guiding
content presentation to resonate with the masses required for viral
breakthroughs. Top formats oer a versatile canvas for creators to insert their

messages and creativity. For instance, a format such as Visual Metaphor
(explained in depth in Part II) can be applied across diverse topics but retains
its recognizable structure.
Understanding formats is crucial for organizing your content research
eectively. It’s essential to compare content within the same format, focusing
on clusters with common structural, narrative, or thematic elements. is
method enhances your ability to analyze not only the eectiveness of each
format but also the specic qualitative components that contribute to their
success.
A simple way to grasp the concept of formats and how to use them is by
drawing a parallel with movies. e identical three-act structure, or format, is
used in almost every lm to craft both an Academy Award–winning movie
and the worst one you’ve ever seen. What sets the two apart isn’t the structure
itself, but rather, the qualitative components such as dialogue, acting,
cinematography, pacing, and tone. Similarly, in content creation, it’s vital to
compare videos within the same format to identify which qualitative elements
make some stand out over others.
You can also think of a format as a study system. If scientists wanted to do
research on how pollution aects rivers, they wouldn’t examine lakes, oceans,
and creeks. ese are all bodies of water, but they’re dissimilar enough from
rivers that including them would greatly inuence and muddle the results. In
the same way, funny cat videos and how-to content both appear on Instagram,
but comparing them against each other would be pointless and render our
analysis meaningless.
Begin by identifying content formats that consistently deliver excellent
performance. Look for patterns of success with a single format across various
content creators’ accounts, ensuring that each creator has at least ve to ten
successful examples of using a specic format. is approach helps to

distinguish formats that are genuinely eective from those that might have
been one-time hits or a eeting trend. Once you’ve identied such a format,
delve into breaking down its performance drivers. Our approach typically
starts with format identication, followed closely by the analysis of such
drivers.
Cross-industry analysis can provide valuable insights as well. For example,
examining how lawyers and doctors use certain content formats can oer
perspectives applicable to dierent elds, such as tax accountants or real estate
agents. In niches with limited successful examples, broadening your research
scope may be necessary. Such an approach is eective because it emphasizes the
context and qualitative elements driving success, rather than focusing solely on
the content itself.
Be aware of dierent baseline view counts for various format types. For
example, music videos are wildly popular, and high-performers may receive
billions of views. In contrast, tness videos cater to a smaller audience; perhaps
their high-performing content may receive hundreds of thousands to millions
of views. In other words, a super performer in tness content may get the
same number of views as a low performer in music content. If you don’t take
this into consideration, you may incorrectly identify some of the tness
content as low-performers. is misclassication would create a domino eect,
causing you to miss key performance drivers in your analysis.
Step-by-Step Process for Finding Formats for Your Research:
TikTok and YouTube
To nd formats for your content on TikTok and YouTube, try these steps:
Keyword search: Enter keywords related to your eld, or even
unrelated ones, into the TikTok and YouTube search bars.
Remember, you’re searching for formats, not just topics. Use

ChatGPT and Google to discover additional related keywords.
Examples include “Real Estate,” “Product Reviews,” “Dog
Training,” “Business Coach,” and so on.
Identify viral videos: Focus on videos with high view counts. Visit
the creator’s page to see if they have more content in similar
formats. If the rst account isn’t fruitful, return to your search and
look for another viral video. If your initial keyword doesn’t pull up
viral videos or creators, try using a dierent, related keyword.
Keyword combinations: Mix topical keywords with format-specic
ones for diverse results. For example, combine “Nutrition” (topic)
with “Challenge” (format), or “Cooking” (topic) with “Hacks”
(format).
General format keywords: Enhance your topic searches with these
format category keywords that can help you identify popular
content structures within your topic area:
FOR INSTAGRAM
Instagram’s search functionality diers from TikTok and YouTube,
requiring a dierent approach to nd content formats. Use these strategies to

navigate Instagram eectively and identify popular content formats for your
use:
Use the mobile app: Search for content using the Instagram mobile
app, not the desktop browser, for optimal functionality. Click on
the Search icon, type in what you want to search for, and tap
Search.
Navigate to reels: After searching, you’ll see options like “For you,
accounts, audio . . .” at the top of the screen. Scroll horizontally
through these options to nd “reels” at the end and select it to focus
on the reels feed.
Checking view counts: To see how popular a video is, tap on it and
visit the account’s reels page. Look for videos with high view counts,
as they indicate popular formats.
Manual scrolling: Since there’s no way to sort videos by
performance on Instagram, manually scroll through and take note
of the performance of each video. Consider keeping a record for
better analysis.
Identify repeatable formats: Watch multiple videos from the same
account to see if they consistently use a particular format. is will
help you understand which formats are repeatable and potentially
successful.
In Part II of this book, I’ll reveal some of Hook Point’s favorite Viral
Formats that you can use to inspire your own content, but for now, keep in
mind that there’s a plethora of dierent formats out there—hundreds, in fact.
Your favorite content creator probably uses one or two consistently. Once you
truly grasp the intricacies of the importance of the qualitative elements that

enhance a video’s performance through your research, you’ll be able to nd
success within a specic format. If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed by the
prospect of conducting research yourself, my team at Hook Point oers
custom research services for clients. To learn more, please visit:

Selecting Creators or Formats to Analyze
To commence your research, begin by choosing either a specic creator or
a content format that draws your interest. It’s important to focus narrowly,
particularly if a creator utilizes various formats. Only analyze one format at a
time to maintain clarity in your research.
Once you’ve selected a creator or format, prepare to document your
ndings. Identify two to four social media channels that are relevant to your
research needs. Prioritize content from the platform you intend to engage with
most—whether it’s Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, or some other one. is
targeted approach will ensure that your research is directly applicable to your
intended use.
Copy and paste the content you select into a table like the one below:
CRITERIA
e pages you select should meet these criteria:
1. Consistent high views: Content should consistently receive
hundreds of thousands to millions of views. For example:

Good candidate: A creator whose videos consistently get
one million views.
Bad candidate: A creator with one video that has 20
million views but normally only receives 10,000 views
or fewer.
2. Success not based on status: Avoid content whose success is tied
to celebrity, brand identity, or other nonreplicable factors.
Consider whether their success is due to replicable strategies rather
than a one-o success or their social/business status.
You can include brands that use social media to drive
brand awareness and growth, such as Duolingo on
TikTok.
Exclude major brands or celebrities like Apple or Lady
Gaga, whose identities drive their social media success.
3. Organic performance: Focus on content whose performance is
organically driven rather than driven by large media spends.
Content primarily driven by ads typically has a likes-to-view ratio
below 1 percent.
Categorizing Content by Performance: Gold, Silver, and Bronze
To conduct our qualitative research process, we developed a system called
Gold, Silver, and Bronze (GSB). To utilize this system, start by identifying a
content creator or format. en, document your observations within a
research sheet, for which we typically use Google Sheets. For example, look at
the research sheet that my team created to analyze a creator named Dylan
Page, who operates the number-one news account on TikTok. Remember, you
can view all resources and videos throughout the chapter at:
http://guide.hookpoint.com/.





Within this research sheet, data is categorized into three performance tiers:
1. Gold content: is category represents the pinnacle of
performance within its format, outshining typical results. ink

of this as the standout, breakthrough viral content that garners
exceptional attention. To discern what contributes to its viral
success, we identify and analyze its performance drivers,
contrasting them against low and baseline performers to spot
similarities and dierences in performance drivers among these
groups. Limiting our analysis solely to Gold content could
potentially exaggerate the importance of certain nuances.
2. Silver content: is tier signies the baseline number of views
that a creator (or creators within the same format) consistently
achieves. e number of views for Silver content approximates
the value that appears most frequently within our content sample.
(In statistics, this most-common value is also called the “mode.”)
We use this mode value rather than the mean number of views to
dene Silver content because extremely viral or poorly
performing videos could skew the mean, leading to
misclassication.
3. Bronze content: is category denotes content that falls below a
creator’s or format’s median view count. In comparison to their
baseline and breakthrough content, the view count for Bronze
content would be disappointing for the creator.
Note: ese tiers aren’t tied to specic view counts; instead, they’re relative
within a format and not across all content. As you comprehensively analyze a
format, you’ll discover dierent baseline view counts for various format types,
and you’ll establish the characteristic view count range for each tier.
When selecting a creator or format for your study, begin with identifying
the Gold high-performing videos. Subsequently, investigate the Bronze low-
performing ones, and then proceed to the Silver-ranked videos. Your analysis

will primarily compare high-performing (Gold) and low-performing videos
(Bronze) videos. However, you need to understand the creator’s average
performance (Silver) to accurately identify these categories. Analyzing Gold
versus Bronze videos makes it easier to pinpoint the tactics and performance
drivers that result in dierent EOVs and helps you understand how they
inuence the videos’ overall success. As you gain more experience, you’ll
become adept at identifying the dierences in videos categorized as Silver from
Gold and Bonze. However, it is better to start with the more distinct contrasts.
Consider the number of subscribers or followers on the creator’s page as an
initial metric. Although it’s not a denitive measure, it oers a glimpse of the
account’s reach. Analyze accounts with consistent viral potential, and avoid
those with minimal followers, such as accounts with only 30,000 followers,
which may not have demonstrated consistent virality. Exercise caution with
accounts created by big brands or celebrities, as their popularity may be
attributed to oine fame, not the content’s quality.
Applying this analysis to your content is possible, but until you experience
substantial growth, keeping tabs on other creators’ performance is a smart
strategy. is will provide insights to rene your content strategy.
In your analysis, closely examine the view count for each post or video
within the chosen format. For instance, a creator might regularly achieve
between 100,000 and 300,000 views, with occasional spikes reaching 600,000,
or even surpassing one million (Gold). In such scenarios, the expected (Silver)
range for this creator would be 100,000 to 300,000 views. Additionally, note
the content pieces that underperform (Bronze), such as those only amassing
10,000 or 15,000 views. Some creators may consider boosting their content to
increase views, but it’s essential to understand that top creators typically rely on
organic reach and engagement.
Overview of Information to Include on Your GSB Sheet

As you gather your references of videos or posts, you’ll organize them into
a GSB sheet. Here’s an overview of the type of information that will be
included on this sheet:
Tier: Indicate which GSB category the video belongs to based on its
performance.
Video (link, title, and summary): Provide the URL of the video or
post for reference, the title of the video, and a brief summary of the
content and its theme.
Page: Note the name of the creator’s page.
Video views: Record the number of views the video has received.
Notes: Add any specic observations or notes you have about the
video’s content, structure, or style.
Key ndings: As you dive into videos from each tier, it’s imperative
to note recurring themes or patterns. Here’s a checklist of some
elements to look out for; however, keep in mind that this is not an
exhaustive list. At Hook Point, we have a library of over 1,000
performance driver key ndings to select from, but we typically
narrow it down to three to ve per format. Here are just a few
aspects to consider:
Common elements: Are there recurring symbols,
characters, or props?
Storytelling techniques: Analyze the structure. Is there a
specic pattern, like a problem-solution format?
Pacing: Is the video fast-paced throughout, or does it
have moments of pause? How does this impact viewer
engagement?

Tonality: What is the mood of the video? Upbeat,
dramatic, melancholic, or humorous?
Environment/setting: Where is the video shot? Indoors,
outdoors, studio, or on location?
Opening sequence: Pay close attention to the rst three
seconds. What is used to grab the viewer’s attention
immediately?
Lighting: Is it consistent? Does it vary based on mood
or setting?
Cadence: Listen to the rhythm of speech or music. Is it
steady or does it vary?
Camera techniques: Any noticeable trends in camera
movements, angles, or focus?
A Step-by-Step Data Entry Process for Filling Out a GSB Sheet
Let me walk you through the step-by-step process for lling out a GSB
sheet. For a video walkthrough and to download a template of the GSB sheet,
go to: http://guide.hookpoint.com/.
STARTING WITH A BLANK SHEET
A blank GSB sheet looks like this:

ENTERING DATA FOR GOLD TOP PERFORMERS
Next, from your references, identify and document the Gold top-
performing content.
On the GSB sheet:
Enter the video title in the VIDEO column under the Gold
section, and hyperlink it using Command + K (Control + K on
Windows).
Record the page’s name in the PAGE column.
Note the number of views in the VIEWS column.
Enter the number of followers/subscribers in the
FOLLOWERS/SUBS column.
After entering data for Gold performers, the GSB sheet will look like this:

IDENTIFYING LOW-PERFORMING BRONZE VIDEOS
Next, identify low-performing Bronze videos, and record their statistics.

IDENTIFYING SILVER BASELINE PERFORMERS
en, determine the Silver baseline content, and document their statistics.
ANALYZING GOLD PERFORMERS
Watch Gold performer videos to nd common elements among these top
videos, noting any recurring patterns or tactics that may contribute to their
success.
Document any observations in the NOTES column, or use a separate
document if preferred.

TESTING HYPOTHESES WITH BRONZE VIDEOS
Evaluate whether patterns identied in Gold videos also appear in Bronze
ones to determine if they are signicant performance drivers:
If patterns are found in both Gold and Bronze videos, they may not
be key performance drivers.

Patterns exclusive to Gold videos likely contribute to high
performance, whereas those exclusive to Bronze videos may detract
from performance.
COMPILING KEY FINDINGS
In the KEY FINDINGS section:
List the core performance drivers based on your analysis.
Support each hypothesis with examples from both Gold and Bronze
tiers, demonstrating the eect of these drivers on video
performance.
is structured approach ensures that you’ll systematically capture and
analyze performance data across dierent content tiers, enabling you to
identify the qualitative factors that drive successful social media content.
A fully completed GSB sheet with the Key Findings section lled out will
appear as follows:

The Importance of Classifying Research with GSB
In our analysis, we compare high-, average-, and low-performing content
to determine which creative nuances exclusively appear in top-performing
content. Simply watching viral videos isn’t sucient; we must contrast them
with low performers to identify the similarities and dierences between the
two groups. If we only watch viral content, we won’t be able to determine
which elements are driving performance.
For example, imagine we watch ve top-performing videos and ve low-
performing videos in the tness space. All 10 videos incorporate a trending
dramatic song. However, only the ve top performers showcase reactions from
strangers—bystanders who unexpectedly encounter the tness activity and
display emotional reactions such as awe, shock, or surprise when viewing the
tness enthusiast’s abilities. If the trending dramatic song was the sole factor

driving virality, all 10 videos should ideally perform similarly, since they all
incorporate the song. Yet, this isn’t the case. We can infer that the spontaneous
reactions from strangers—present only in the top-performing Gold content—
play a signicant role in making those ve videos go viral.
Now, contemplate a scenario where we only watch the ve high-
performing videos and exclude the low performers from our analysis. In that
case, we might mistakenly assume that the trending dramatic song and
reactions were equally important.
It’s worth noting that, as is typical in research, we encounter outlier
content that thrives despite lacking a crucial driver. Generally, we account for
outliers by highlighting that multiple drivers often interact to foster success.
For example, let’s introduce another low-performing video into our earlier
example. is video does feature the “reactions of strangers” driver, consistent
with the ve top-performing videos. But it lacks close-up shots (another
performance driver) that provide clear views of the reactions. Similarly,
although key performance drivers might not appear in every piece of viral
content, they tend to appear in the majority of cases.
Format Denes Tier
Suppose we’re analyzing a hypothetical video with one million views. If this
video were part of the larger Omegle Reactions format (a format where
musicians engage with strangers on Omegle, a platform similar to Skype for
random one-on-one video chats, and then later post these sessions on
YouTube), it could be classied as an average performing video. is might
surprise you, as you’d think that one million views should place it in the top
status (Gold/high performer). However, our classication is based on how the
video performs within its specic format, not across all types of content.

In the Omegle Reactions format, which is used successfully by creators such
as Marcus Veltri, viral videos often garner more than ve million views, with
one million views being the average. However, in the context of the “What’s
Your Favorite Book?” format—one often seen on TikTok and Instagram
where librarians and bookstore owners share their favorite books, successfully
utilized by creators like D. A. Murray, Joshua Robinson, and Schuler Books—
a video with 700,000 views is deemed a top performer. us, a video with one
million views would be classied as high-performing Gold tier within this
format.
How This Works for You
You might believe that 700,000 views, or even slightly below-average
performance for the Omegle Reactions format, is an ideal target. However, the
goal of this process isn’t to necessarily match the exact view count you’re
researching. Instead, it’s about understanding the storytelling elements that
drive success for content creators and applying those insights to your content
strategy.
Identifying Patterns of Video Performance
Once you’ve organized your ndings into the GSB categories on your
research sheet, identifying patterns is the next step. ese patterns could be
found in elements like the topic of the video, the rst three seconds of the
video, the design of video headlines, or the thumbnail designs. For example, a
common YouTube thumbnail style among all the top-performing Gold videos
could indicate a potential performance driver. You should test this hypothesis
against the low-performing Bronze videos. If Bronze videos feature similar
thumbnails, it indicates that thumbnails alone do not drive performance. is
insight would then perhaps redirect your focus to the video titles. When the
top-performing videos have common Hook Points or headlines absent in the

Bronze videos, it demonstrates that these elements are crucial for driving
performance and capturing audience attention.
To see this pattern recognition process in action, let’s analyze the YouTube
channel Answer in Progress. is channel has amassed more than 1.38 million
subscribers and is known for its investigative format, posing compelling life
questions and engaging viewers with a mix of on-site discovery, dynamic
research, and storytelling that often mirrors the complexity of a conspiracy.
eir video Your City Is Full of Fake Buildings, Here’s Why achieved more than
6.7 million views, featuring a thumbnail with a dramatic facial expression,
contrasting colors, and imagery that suggests a deeper story. Combined with a
title teasing a conspiracy, it entices viewers into a journey of discovery. In
contrast, e Real Reason Ice Is Slippery presents a straightforward question
with a less captivating thumbnail, leading to a modest 96,000 views.
Further analysis of I Tried 5 Types of Water (to Find the Best One) and Why
Japan’s Internet Is Weirdly Designed reinforces these ndings. e water video,
with its linear and predictable topic, didn’t resonate as strongly, achieving
203,000 views. Meanwhile, the video on Japan’s internet design, which
explores a unique cultural phenomenon, captivated a much larger audience,
with 4.6 million views. e stark dierence in performance can be partially
attributed to the latter video’s layered exploration depicted within its
thumbnail and title, which implies a story rich in depth and complexity. is is
one of the important factors inuencing the disparate outcomes.

is analysis reveals a clear pattern: High-performing YouTube thumbnails
typically include dramatic facial expressions, suggest depth, explore multiple
perspectives, and use contrast to create visual intrigue. ey pair eectively
with titles that ask broad, open-ended questions or make startling statements,
prompting viewers to seek answers. is pattern suggests that such thumbnails
and titles pique viewers’ curiosity, inviting them to participate in unraveling
the mystery alongside the host.
Lower-performing videos, by contrast, often lack this narrative promise in
their thumbnails and titles, reducing the viewer’s need for exploration. ey
often present the core answer or theme directly, leaving little room for the
viewer’s curiosity to grow. is analysis highlights the importance of a
thumbnail that’s not only eye-catching but also complements a title, together
weaving the beginning of an engaging story that the video then expands upon.
is distinction also points to the value of creating content that invites viewers
to join in on the discovery process, fostering a sense of community and shared
inquiry.
By integrating these insights, you can rene your approach to thumbnails
and titles, adopting the storytelling techniques observed in Answer in Progress.
Applying this strategy to new content enables you to evaluate whether a
compelling thumbnail-and-title combination signicantly boosts viewer
engagement and video performance.
During this analysis, you may also observe variations in the look and feel
of the video, or the cadence of the speaker. Bronze videos may come across as

amateurish, while Gold videos may captivate you and establish a stronger
connection with the video creator. Gold videos often incorporate an element
of suspense, which becomes apparent when juxtaposing them with lower-
performing videos. Additionally, higher-performing videos often evoke
curiosity rather than simply oering information, making them more
engaging for the masses. You’ll also begin to discern which content subjects
truly resonate and make people care.
Noticing Patterns across Industries
After identifying initial patterns, it’s benecial to cross-check them with
content from a completely dierent subject area that uses the same format. For
this example, let’s consider the “Two Characters, One Lightbulb” format,
popular among creators such as Mark Tilbury and Erika Kulberg. is format
features two characters, often played by the same individual: a novice
representing the average viewer who has a common misconception about a
topic, and an expert character who claries the misconception, leading to an
enlightening “lightbulb” moment. If your analysis began with Kulberg’s legal
videos using this format, you might then explore its use in Tilbury’s nance
videos. e aim is to discover unique patterns that drive success within each
content category.
Although tax and medical videos may perform well by presenting facts and
information in an innovative visual style, other content verticals may require a
more exploratory and narrative-driven approach. By analyzing dierent
industries using the same format, you gain a more holistic understanding of
the diverse patterns and performance drivers across topics. You may even
discover that certain performance drivers are universal, transcending the
boundaries of specic content areas.`
Understanding Content Potential:
Eliminate One-Hit Wonders

When conducting research, it’s crucial to look for formats that consistently
achieve hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of views. is level of
consistent success is a strong indicator of high potential as a place to draw
insights for your own content. Even if you come across a video that you like
and it garnered 20 million views, further investigation is needed. Visit the
creator’s prole, and evaluate whether they consistently replicate that level of
success with the same format. If the high view count is a one-time occurrence,
the potential for using it as a model to help you nd consistent performance
might be limited.
Leave Your Personal Tastes at the Door
When categorizing content as “good” or “bad,” it’s essential to clarify that
these labels are not simply reections of personal preferences or subjective
opinions, but rather, are metrics grounded in the performance and success of
the content, gauged by engagement and viewership. For example, although
there may be content creators who don’t align with your personal tastes, if they
consistently generate millions of views, that’s undeniable evidence of a
successful content strategy. Our personal preferences shouldn’t get in the way
of the fact that there’s a wealth of knowledge to learn from, based on their
approach.
On the other hand, content you love that doesn’t garner widespread
attention might not be the best yardstick if you want to achieve vast
viewership. Most of us enjoy content that resonates deeply with our personal
tastes. However, given the diverse interests of the wide viewing audience, the
same content doesn’t always resonate with everyone. Observing content that
achieves enormous viewership should prompt us to gure out why it resonates
rather than pass o the audience’s interest as mere whims or poor taste.
Ultimately, the objective is to discern the patterns and strategies that
consistently yield successful content, enabling us to ne-tune our approach.
Cognitive Biases

Assumptions are the beliefs we hold, often rooted in conventional best
practices. e essence of analysis, however, is to evaluate the underlying factors
that drive content success or failure and understand the reasoning behind it.
is is why, when dissecting content, it’s imperative to leave space for the
unknown and the unexpected, and to challenge our initial assumptions.
Consider, for example, Veritasium’s video titled e Most Common
Cognitive Bias. In it, people are shown a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8. en
they’re asked to guess the rule behind it. Many quickly think the rule involves
just doubling the numbers; so they think of sequences such as 8, 16, 32. But
the sequence 1, 2, 3 also ts the rule. e rule is simple: numbers just need to
be in ascending order. Most people only see this when they try a sequence
where numbers decrease. is is a great example of how we can get stuck on
our rst guess.
When analyzing content, similar pitfalls occur. It’s a common tendency for
people to make assumptions prematurely and then not continue to explore
further to uncover the authentic reason behind a piece of content’s success.
Even if you’re condent in your grasp of why a particular piece of content has
achieved success, it’s essential to challenge yourself and continually work to
verify your hypothesis.
To truly understand what drives performance, investigate all the
underlying factors. Treat your initial ideas as hypotheses, and try to disprove
them as soon as possible. When you nd a hypothesis that you can’t break, you
are onto a signicant nding, and you can start building content concepts
from there.
Tactics vs. Eect on the Viewer (EOV):
Avoid the Copycat Syndrome
In content creation, tactics are every element that you can see and hear,
including the words, music, visuals, and story structure. Although crucial, these
tactics alone are insucient to captivate an audience. Viewers don’t engage

with content simply because the music was nice, or the lighting was dramatic.
eir engagement is much more dependent on the EOV.
e EOV refers to the impact that a tactic or tactics have on the viewer. It’s
a performance driver that focuses on intangible yet powerful experiences for
the audience. e content moves them emotionally through dramatic
storytelling, reversal of expectations, surprise, change of perspective, or an
overall “gut punch.” Some common examples include gaining clarity, sparking
curiosity, or feeling satised.
In content analysis, focusing on the EOV is more crucial than simply
replicating tactics. For example, the prevalence of on-screen text in high-
performing videos suggests its potential benet. However, understanding the
specic EOV that it generates is vital. Adding text without considering the
desired response may not be eective. e objective is to comprehend how top
videos utilize text to boost engagement, not to simply mimic their tactics.
My team analyzed Mark Rober’s “Watch Me Work” format, where experts
share how-to tutorials or skills, and we observed that successful videos in this
format generally start with a strategically chosen teaser. ese aren’t arbitrary
clips, but rather, carefully crafted scenes that create a clihanger, building
tension and anticipation that keeps the audience engaged. e success lies in
using the teaser to produce a particular EOV: anticipation.
As an example, take Rober’s viral video World’s Largest Jello Pool–Can You
Swim in Jello?, which has more than 138 million views: he begins by speaking
from within a Jello pool, then the video cuts to him about to dive in, stopping
just before the plunge. is approach not only piques viewers’ curiosity but
also taps into their emotions, fostering a sense of expectancy crucial to the
video’s strategic appeal.
Remember, the objective of content analysis is to extract valuable insights
from successful content, identify the essential elements driving its impact, and

apply those elements to your content to achieve comparable engagement. So,
before adopting any tactic, it’s essential to consider its potential EOV.
GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE EXERCISE
To begin, access a blank GSB sheet and view a partially lled-out GSB
sheet at: http://guide.hookpoint.com/.
Remember, a fully lled-out GSB sheet will look like this:

CREATING YOUR GSB SHEET
Now, let’s start by creating your GSB sheet for a top creator in your niche.
Focus your initial analysis on creators averaging around one million views.
Although those attaining an average of 50,000 views might still oer value,
homing in on industry leaders—even if their brand or oerings diverge from
yours—unveils potent formats that could propel your content to virality.
Realize that achieving consistent viral hits without relying on a tried-and-true
format is a steep uphill battle.
KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR DISCOVERIES
Organize your ndings using tools such as Excel or Google Sheets, or the
blank GSB sheet provided above.

UNDERSTANDING YOUR COLUMNS
When lling out your GSB research sheet, include the following:
Video: Insert a link to the video.
Views: Record the number of views received by the video.
Page: Write down the name of the creator’s page.
Notes: Describe the content briey, including the name and a
summary, if needed. An example of a summary is as follows: “Video
contrasts a novice character earning $80,000 annually to an expert
earning the same but with fewer work hours, ending with a website
call to action.” Also document specic tactics and observations, and
whether they pertain to visual techniques or narrative nuances. is
could encompass details from lighting strategies, character interplay,
and specic typographical elements.
For example, you might notice how a video strategically uses color contrast
to distinguish and amplify distinct messages from dierent characters. A
potential observation could read: “e video employs depth dierentiation
between the character and the background, utilizing two contrasting colors for
text accompanied by emojis. A ring light enhances the lighting, providing
clarity. e narrative direction of the video makes the expert’s perspective
appear both appealing and easily achievable. A noteworthy contrast is drawn
between the salaries of the two characters, emphasizing the vast disparity in the
eort expended by the novice and expert.”
Key ndings: is column is central to your analysis. From here,
you can draw hypotheses about performance drivers. One of the
primary focuses should be on understanding the EOV to identify
patterns contributing to a format’s success.

Top-performing content frequently incorporates tactics such as teasers,
captions, and unique script structures. It’s essential not only to identify these
tactics but also to understand their impact on audiences, or the EOV. By
grasping the core reasons a specic tactic, such as a caption or teaser, resonates
with viewers, you can craft content that channels similar emotions in your
distinct style, avoiding mere imitation.
It’s worth noting that our initial response to content is emotional; it’s about
how it makes us feel. Yet, during analysis, the focus often shifts predominantly
to tactics. Bridging this divide—melding emotional resonance with tactical
insight—is crucial in your research.
Some of the key performance drivers inuencing success can be
“cleverness,” “absurdity,” “contrast,” “making complex topics seem easy,” and
“leaving viewers wanting more.” When you see patterns emerging in top-
performing content, it’s imperative to thoroughly examine how these elements
work—understanding their structure and impact—to eectively apply them in
your own content strategies.
To provide clarity, here are a few common examples from our analysis of
dierent formats to guide you in lling out the “Key ndings” column:
Cleverness: Cleverness intertwines the smart with the unexpected to
create a multilayered impact. Keep in mind the formula: clever =
smart + unexpected. Practical applications:
a. Clever process: Use dynamic visual metaphors to breathe
new life into well-worn topics. When revisiting standard
procedures, weave in unexpected elements or rare
combinations that intrigue and surprise. For example,
consider the use of crumpled paper in a wastebasket to
represent trauma, as seen in Dr. Julie’s e Trauma

Basket, which has garnered more than 7.6 million views.
Another example can be found in Hot Ones interviews,
where guests face the challenge of answering questions
while eating chicken wings with super-hot sauce.
b. Clever ideas: Steer clear of rehashing known content.
Brainstorm fresh perspectives on familiar subjects, or
ingeniously repurpose everyday items. Link unrelated
concepts in novel ways that spark curiosity and insight.
For instance, conventional videography techniques can
cleverly focus on mundane objects like a spoon or a
crumb. An example of this is seen in Grace Wells’ A Very
Crummy Commercial, which has garnered more than
22.4 million views.
c. Parodies: Select familiar, topical material for parodies.
Exaggerate features to highlight underlying
contradictions or absurdities, and balance humor with
commentary to craft satire that entertains while it
critiques—for example, the is Is a Generic Brand Video
by Dissolve, which has garnered more than 2.9 million
views, eectively demonstrates the company’s stock
footage library. It critiques the standard business video
format while playfully emphasizing Dissolve’s distinctive
selling points.
Absurdity: Engaging an audience can be achieved through the
unexpected and illogical. Absurdity creates a distinctive and
memorable experience. Absurd situations are characterized by their
nonsensical, peculiarly specic, bizarre, inappropriate, unreasonable,

or silly nature, often combining elements that would not normally
be seen together. Examples include:
a. Novel scenarios: Content that introduces unusually
specic tasks or challenges, such as Areyoukiddingtv’s
video titled Yes, Microwaved Is Acceptable with more than
51.7 million views, which asks students to deliver cooked
mac-n-cheese, toss a book, and pour apple juice on
themselves. e sheer oddity of these requests commands
attention and piques curiosity.
b. Provoking genuine reactions: Absurdity can elicit
authentic reactions, as seen in atWasEpic’s video titled
Cutting People’s Earphones, en Giving em Airpods,
with more than 53 million views, which features a prank
that involves cutting a person’s headphone cords. e
viewer gets a candid glimpse of the person’s emotions,
from confusion to shock, providing a raw and engaging
experience.
c. Escapism through content: Absurd videos serve as a portal
away from the routine, oering viewers an unusual
experience that they eagerly consume during their daily
scrolls. is can be a potent tool for creators to captivate
and maintain an audience’s focus.
Contrast: Contrast serves as a dominant driver in video content,
whether it’s embedded within the concept or exhibited in its
presentation. Examples include:
a. Scenario contrasts: Imagine two individuals boasting the
same income but their work dynamics are poles apart—
one might be entangled in a nine-to-ve oce routine,

while the other enjoys exibility, working just a few
hours from the comfort of home.
b. Visual contrasts: Take a culinary scene where one dish is
presented as a gourmet delight, and its counterpart
appears bland and uninviting.
c. Reality vs. perception: is could be the contrast drawn
between prevailing myths and actual facts, such as
demystifying the home-buying process by distinguishing
between popular beliefs about nancial prerequisites and
the real conditions.
Make it seem easy: Top-performing creators have a knack for
distilling complex solutions or ideas into easily digestible content.
eir approach:
a. Simplicity over complexity: Rather than bombarding
viewers with intricate details, they prioritize clarity and
conciseness, ensuring that the information remains
valuable.
b. Showcasing achievability: By demonstrating that they’ve
reached their goals through uncomplicated means, they
inspire viewers to believe that they can do the same.
c. Effective messaging: Utilizing relatable phrases can drive
home the point. Statements such as “You can still eat
more food,” “Food doesn’t have to be bland,” or “You
don’t need 40,000, just an FHA loan and 7,000,”
resonate by stripping away the jargon and speaking
directly to viewer needs and desires.

Leave viewers wanting more: Eective creators harness the power
of curiosity, oering just enough to entice viewers while holding
back to maintain intrigue. eir strategies include:
a. Teasing future content: By presenting a fascinating idea
without fully unpacking it, creators set the stage for
follow-up content, be it a “Part 2” or subsequent
episodes.
b. Promoting further engagement: Encouraging viewers to
subscribe or follow ensures that they remain in the loop
for future content, bolstering platform engagement.
c. Highlighting tangible benets: Stating specic, desirable
outcomes such as “Work from home for 15 minutes a
week” or “Enjoy tastier food without breaking the bank”
creates a compelling incentive for viewers to return and
learn more.
Over time, recognizing these patterns will become second nature, and you
won’t need to meticulously document each detail. With practice, you’ll

CASE STUDY: HOOK POINT ASSISTS
HAND SURGEON ERIN NANCE, MD,
IN ACHIEVING SOCIAL MEDIA SUCCESS
Introduction: Dr. Erin Nance, a distinguished hand surgeon with a thriving
private practice, aimed to highlight her expertise in reality TV through her
media company Hands on Media, and to secure a publishing deal for her
book. To enhance her viewership and broaden her social media inuence, she
collaborated with Hook Point.
Background: At the beginning of her digital journey, Nance had no social
media presence. Starting from scratch with zero followers and no experience,
she faced the daunting task of creating engaging hand surgery content. In the
early stages, her videos barely crossed the 500-view mark. But her
determination and perseverance paved the way for the growth that followed.
Challenge:. e primary challenge was creating engaging content that
highlighted Nance’s expertise in hand surgery, designed to go viral and
captivate the masses while also boosting her digital visibility.
Solution: In a combined eort, Nance and our team pinpointed the
shortcomings in her initial content strategy. We introduced her to a detailed
content analysis methodology and strategies for maximizing audience

engagement, emphasizing the techniques elaborated in the Viral Content
Model. Specically, we guided Nance to utilize the major communication
styles (which you’ll learn about in Part III of this book) to create dramatized
videos. ese videos narrate real moments she experienced as a doctor and
fascinating tales from medical literature, serving the dual purpose of
entertaining and educating the viewer. Collaboratively, we rened her video
presentations to not only reect her expertise but also to resonate authentically
with viewers.
Results: In just a few months, Nance witnessed transformative results. Her
videos amassed more than 100 million views, 10 million likes on her content,
and her follower count surged to over 700,000. is newfound visibility
established her as a leading voice in the eld of hand surgery. Several of her
videos—each attracting more than 2.5 million views—have propelled her
growth, opening doors to new opportunities such as keynote speaking
engagements, her rst book deal, and discussions with producers about turning
her insights into a TV show. Attributing her digital ascent to the combined
insights and collaboration, Nance rmly believes in the power of persistence,
experimentation, and continual learning in the realm of social media.
In the next chapter, we will delve further into rening your content
analysis skills.

CHAPTER 3
THE SUBTLE SCIENCE: THE
POWER OF PRECISION IN
CONTENT ANALYSIS
In the realm of content analysis, sharpening your ability to understand and
evaluate content becomes your secret weapon. is chapter is all about giving
you the tools to analyze the content you come across on social media, helping
you gure out what works and what doesn’t when it comes to getting attention
and engagement.
By sharpening your analytical abilities, you’ll start to notice the tactics to
avoid and the subtle nuances to incorporate into your content strategy. is
newfound awareness will empower you to make informed decisions about the
direction of your content, ultimately making it more impactful and eective.
Remember, the key lies in your ability to discern between what truly works
and what falls at. Get ready to boost your understanding and ne-tune your
content game like never before. Let’s dive in and discover the magic behind
great content!
Recognizing Performance Drivers
Our brains naturally seek patterns and simplications to make sense of the
world. Imagine frequenting a cozy diner every morning at 8 a.m. You receive
excellent service and delicious food from the same friendly sta. Naturally,
your experience prompts you to leave a stellar ve-star review for this diner
based on your positive experiences.

While writing your Google review, you discover a two-star rating, and
you’re surprised. After some reection, you realize that your positive
experience is specic to the fact that you visit during less crowded hours. As the
place gets busier, the quality of service drops due to fewer sta members. is
scenario shows how our personal experiences shape our conclusions.
Similarly, when analyzing a piece of content, we often rely on our own
experiences and draw conclusions through the lens of what we’ve seen before.
Yet, it’s essential to refrain from making hasty judgments based solely on the
success of a single video, even if it racks up 20 million views.
Instead, we should broaden our perspective and examine a diverse range of
top- and bottom-performing content. Performance drivers—the pivotal
factors that inuence a video’s success or failure in terms of views, watch time,
and engagement—often diverge from our initial assumptions. ey emerge
from objective analysis rather than our personal experiences. By adopting this
approach, we gain a deeper understanding of the true drivers that steer content
toward success.
Common Downward Performance Drivers
Before we move on to exploring eective upward performance drivers, let’s
rst take a closer look at the typical missteps that often lead to unsatisfactory
results. With years of research and analysis under our belt, my team and I have
identied several common factors that consistently hinder performance. By
recognizing and avoiding these practices, you can steer clear of these pitfalls
and position yourself for success. Here are four of the most frequently
observed downward performance drivers:
1. Overt branding: e traditional thought process involved in
focusing on color, palettes, typefaces, and consistency stemming
from traditional media doesn’t translate well to social media

platforms. In the past, when advertisements appeared
infrequently in magazines, branding played a crucial role in
creating memorability. However, social media operates dierently.
On social media, users are constantly exposed to a vast amount of
content, and their consumption is often passive. So, while rigid
branding may appeal to a marketing manager, it doesn’t usually
resonate with social media users. Viewers don’t care about your
branding; in fact, noticing that your content is branded will deter
viewers. No one ever logs on to social media thinking, I want to
engage with a great branded piece of content.
Today, with all the content that is available on social media, most
people have become professional content consumers—they have a
sixth sense about whether there’s an underlying agenda or excessive
branding. And yet, many of the most successful corporations in the
world make the mistake of failing to notice this and adapt their
content to the social media landscape. Even a renowned company such
as Starbucks, with its widespread brand awareness, still feels the need to
constantly emphasize its logo.
is strikes me as somewhat perplexing, since we’re already exposed to
the Starbucks logo almost every day, simply by driving around.
However, everything they create on social media remains xated on
their brand and logo. is singular focus prevents them from
implementing strong narrative structures. ey’re unable to explore
new creative avenues because they’re consumed by their brand identity.
2. Focusing on high production value: High production value
doesn’t automatically correlate to success on social media
platforms. In many cases, the quality of production elements—

such as video resolution, audio clarity, or lighting—is not the
primary driver of success or failure. Surprisingly, content created
with more modest means often steals the limelight in terms of
views and engagement that truly matters.

Let’s take a look: Adidas, a major player with 26 million followers,
posts a video centered around the Adidas Adizero shoe: (remember all
videos and resources in this chapter can be viewed at:
http://guide.hookpoint.com/), and lands a mere 90,000 views. en,
Harrison Nevel, a less-recognized gure with around 44,000 followers,
amasses 994,000 views on his shoe-promo video, Levitating Shoe.

Adidas’s video features beautiful visuals, polished graphics, and well-
crafted music. Undoubtedly, a considerable budget was invested in its
creation. Yet, despite the nesse and money put into it, the video
underperformed, receiving limited viewership and minimal
engagement. A closer look reveals that the video is a montage, a visual
spectacle that’s challenging to understand or connect with when the
sound is muted. is greatly works against the video’s eectiveness
when you consider that approximately 60 percent of users on
Instagram and Facebook watch videos without audio.
In contrast, Nevel’s video features audio that’s overshadowed by loud
music, is shot on an iPhone, and has lighting that is less than ideal. But
these production limitations don’t matter, as the content itself is so
compelling. e focus shifts from production value to the value of the
content itself. Nevel creates a mesmerizing shoe display that gives o
the illusion of the footwear oating and spinning in the air. It’s not just
visually appealing; it serves a purpose too. Ultimately, Nevel’s
authenticity trumps Adidas’s ashy and heavily branded content.
Nevel’s video is also able to grab attention without audio. e easy-to-
follow visuals instantly spark curiosity. ere’s no mystery about the
story being told. e communication is linear, and it hooks viewers—
and these are drivers that are way more signicant than production
value.
When communicating your message, it’s important to strike a balance
between conveying information and providing entertainment value.
Many companies mistakenly prioritize high production value, resulting
in visually stunning content that fails to elicit a meaningful response
from the audience beyond surface-level admiration. e real goal

should be to create content that genuinely resonates with people and
makes them want to watch.
3. Using stock imagery: Stock imagery and video can be an instant
turno for viewers because it lacks authenticity and conveys a
sense of corporate branding. Many brands fall into the trap of
using stock content as a cop-out, not investing the necessary
eort to dierentiate their visuals. However, there’s a caveat here.
When stock imagery is incorporated into a larger piece of
content, such as a vlogumentary or a deep dive, it can help people
visualize certain topics and make the video more dynamic.
Additionally, when used in an ironic or self-aware manner, stock
imagery can also have its place. But generally, people can easily
recognize stock photos, and they’re uninterested in such generic
visuals. It’s recommended to prioritize creating unique, original
visuals that resonate with your audience over relying heavily on
stock materials.
4. Maintaining consistency and standardizing content: e idea
behind curating a visually appealing grid on social media pages,
particularly on Instagram, has led many individuals to
meticulously organize their photos, sometimes creating composite
images using multiple squares. However, this emphasis on an
attractive grid often overlooks the signicance of context and
engagement. When a single image from such a grid appears in a
social media feed, it can feel disjointed and fail to drive trac to
your page. In fact, posting such images typically leads to poor
performance and weakens your standing with the algorithms.

Instead, each image that you post should have the ability to stand
out individually and actively encourage engagement.
Similarly, eorts to standardize the look and feel of images—a trend often
seen on interior design pages—might lead to a cohesive visual aesthetic but
rarely produces high-performing content. Once again, placing an emphasis on
quality content and relevance, and fostering a connection with the audience,
will ultimately generate more positive outcomes than solely prioritizing
visually appealing posts. Only after identifying the right performance drivers
and mastering performance within a specic format should you consider
standardizing elements.
Top-Five Upward Performance Drivers
Now, let’s examine the top-ve upward performance drivers. Remember, a
performance driver represents the elements in a video or combinations of
certain elements that specically inuence a video’s views, watch time, and
positive engagement. It’s important to note that these are the most common
drivers that my team and I have identied, not a comprehensive list of all
performance drivers. is entire system is designed to help you uncover
numerous upward performance drivers as you analyze content. However,
understanding the ones most frequently observed will assist you in integrating
them into your own content and in identifying other inuential factors.
1. Cleverness
Cleverness is the interplay between the unexpected and the intelligent. It is
demonstrated by creators who connect seemingly unrelated ideas in a way that
is both logical and innovative. is often results in novel concepts that
captivate attention. A useful formula to remember is: unexpected + smart =
clever. Cleverness involves engaging the audience with witty language or ideas,

creating memorable experiences that defy expectations, and eliciting the
reaction, “Why didn’t I think of that?”
Leveraging cleverness eectively often requires a deep understanding of the
subject and a creative approach to problem-solving. By coherently and
logically linking two unrelated concepts, content creators can grab their
audience’s attention and prompt them to see a topic in a new light.
For example, consider creators who demonstrate clever process shots while
lming commercials for mundane objects. Grace Wells, in her TikTok Spoon
commercial, with more than 7.4 million views, orchestrates an aha moment by
cleverly combining disparate objects and imagery to produce a witty outcome.
Another instance can be found in Planet Money’s approach to making
nance entertaining: It’s Not One Big Percent, It’s a Bunch of Little Brackets
with eir Own Percents, which garnered more than two million views on
TikTok, transforming something as mundane as tax brackets into compelling
content.
Musicians are also known to embrace cleverness, turning unexpected
sources into catchy tunes. For instance, DanTDM took game sounds from
Minecraft and turned them into a catchy song in his video I Made a Song in
Minecraft!, garnering more than 7.3 million views.
Although cleverness can be challenging to teach or learn, recognizing it
often comes naturally. ese moments showcase a creator’s ingenuity and
quick-wittedness in linking diverse images, ideas, or thoughts. is driver
almost invariably indicates a positive impact on content performance.
2. Absurdity
Absurdity involves the incorporation of unexpected, ridiculous, or illogical
elements to captivate the audience’s attention and craft a memorable

experience. e novelty of an absurd scenario is highly likely to pique viewers’
interest, and the sheer eccentricity of the situation makes it dicult to look
away. Additionally, the absurdity of a situation can elicit reactions of disbelief
from viewers who lack prior context for the experience. When viewers
encounter something so unexpected, it can trigger a range of emotions,
fostering a desire in the audience to continue watching in anticipation of its
resolution. Particularly in today’s oversaturated market, absurd content has the
potential to stand out and grab people’s attention.
ere are two key ways in which absurdity can enhance content. First, the
novelty of an absurd situation is likely to pique our interest and encourage us
to engage with a new storyline. For example, as mentioned earlier, in
Areyoukiddingtv’s video titled Yes, Microwaved Is Acceptable, with more than
51.7 million views, students are asked to deliver cooked mac-n-cheese, throw a
book in the air, and dump apple juice on themselves. e utter weirdness of
the situation makes it hard to look away.
Second, the absurdity of a situation can provoke reactions of disbelief in
viewers who have no prior context for the experience. In the moments before
the person we’re observing realizes what’s happening, we may witness rare,
unltered expressions of their core personality. Again, as mentioned earlier, in
atWasEpic’s video titled Cutting Peoples [sic] Earphones, en Giving em
Airpods, with more than 53 million views, a prankster cuts a woman’s
headphone cords. We’re treated to the mix of emotions passing over her face as
she processes what just happened.
Absurd content oers a literal escape from the mundane, allowing us to see
or experience something outside of our day-to-day lives. Whether scrolling on
the bus, at work, or before bed, many of us seek such an escape. By providing
this kind of experience, absurd content can be a powerful tool for creators
seeking to capture and retain audience attention.

3. Perspective Shift
A perspective shift is a powerful revelation or aha moment that challenges
viewers’ perceptions of the video’s topic by debunking misconceptions,
presenting new ideas, or highlighting dierent viewpoints. It enables creators
to introduce commonly held beliefs and then present topics in innovative and
clever ways. is performance driver prompts a transformative shift in viewers’
perspectives, compelling them to reevaluate the topic in a manner that
challenges their preconceived beliefs or views.
You can create a perspective shift by debunking misconceptions and
subverting expectations, which allowed calltoleap’s video Making $80K at
Home to accumulate more than 3.6 million views. is video demonstrates
how to make $80,000 a year with only one hour of work a month, completely
going against the idea of the modern nine-to-ve workweek.
You can also take your audience’s preconceived notions and completely ip
them on their head to create a performance they won’t forget. For example, in
Yes eory’s Traveling to the Least Visited Country in the World, which garnered
more than 16 million views, they document their travels to the least visited
country, playing o our assumptions that the journey will be a disaster.
However, to everyone’s surprise, their experience turns out to be wildly
positive. is unexpected twist leads to a truly dynamic and unforgettable
moment.
When creating a perspective shift, your aim is to captivate your audience
with a unique and memorable idea that will leave them mesmerized and
pondering new perspectives. Your goal is to have them walking away saying,
“Wow! at was incredible!” and eagerly anticipating the next opportunity to
learn something from you.
4. Viewer Connection

is concept involves forming a personal relationship with viewers and
acknowledging their perspectives. is often includes practices such as
maintaining eye contact, addressing viewers directly by using the pronoun you,
framing your content or message from the average viewers’ points of view, and
predicting what they might think or feel about something you share.
A potent way to create viewer connections is by providing actionable or
educational value. is entails oering information that viewers can
immediately apply, leaving them thinking, I’m glad I watched that.
Another method for establishing a connection with viewers is through
educational insight, which involves presenting intriguing information that not
only satises viewers’ curiosity but also imparts new knowledge. It
dierentiates itself from actionable or practical educational value, which oers
information directly applicable to viewers’ lives. However, it’s important to
note that these terms often overlap, depending on the specic interests and
experiences of the viewers.
Educational insight frequently appears in science and journalism-style
content, where creators delve into the stories behind specic events or
scientic concepts. For example, Vox’s video titled Why We All Need Subtitles
Now, with more than 10 million views, tells the interesting story of how
subtitles became a common xture in content consumption, imparting
intriguing, though not necessarily practical, information. e same can be said
for Veritasium’s viral videos, such as Math’s Fundamental Flaw, with more than
25 million views. To capture and maintain attention, top creators skillfully
integrate educational insight into compelling narratives.
Another way to establish a connection with viewers is by introducing
implications into the content. Implications refer to the broader or more
signicant consequences of a message or story. ey can help viewers
understand why the content is important and how it can impact their lives or

the world around them. By highlighting these broader implications, creators
can generate a sense of urgency and relevance that goes beyond mere
entertainment or curiosity.
Implications can also enhance the appeal of stories for viewers. For
example, in Cheddar’s video Why the U.S. Hates Roundabouts, which has
garnered more than 5.6 million views, a seemingly mundane topic such as
roundabouts becomes much more interesting when the creators highlight the
implications of traditional trac lights, including the increased incidence of
car accidents. By emphasizing the broader consequences of the topic at hand,
the creators can make the content more engaging and relevant to their
audience.
Additional ways to create a strong viewer connection include:
Eye contact: Establishing virtual eye contact by looking directly into
the camera lens can create a more personal and engaging
connection with your viewers.
Meta elements: Incorporating self-referential or self-aware
elements, such as breaking the fourth wall or acknowledging the
medium in which the content is presented, can add a unique and
relatable touch to your videos.
Formal vs. colloquial language use: e choice of language and
tone plays a crucial role in creating a specic mood and engaging
your audience. It’s essential to use the natural syntax, slang, and
communication patterns of your target audience, avoiding
marketing jargon or industry terminology.
Head voice: is refers to using language and expressions that
resonate with your audience on a deep, authentic level. Utilizing

head voice can have a signicant impact on viewer engagement and
may lead to increased impressions and interaction.
Personal pronouns: e use of personal pronouns such as you helps
create a more personal and direct connection with your audience.
Remember, you’re speaking to an individual on the other side of the
screen, so avoid using terms like All of you or Hey, you guys, which
can dilute the personal connection.
All these strategies can help you establish a stronger and more meaningful
bond with your audience, ultimately leading to increased viewer engagement
and loyalty.
5. Tension Building
Tension building is a technique that compels the viewer to eagerly
anticipate what happens next by indicating or creating a problem within the
content, generating a strong desire to see a resolution. Tension can be
eectively heightened by introducing not only a main problem but also several
minor challenges that ultimately lead to the resolution of the initial issue.
A key way to build tension includes “completing the scale,” which involves
delivering a satisfying resolution to the content’s narrative or message, setting
up viewers to think, I absolutely must see what happens next. e resolution can
be dramatic or subtle, manifesting as a visual cue that makes them want to see
the next shot or a pivotal shift in the storyline. is eect can be subconscious
or obvious. In essence, completing the scale is akin to playing a musical scale
on a piano, where the nal note brings about a sense of completion. Content
creators aim to create a promise and fulll it in a way that keeps viewers
engaged. Failing to complete the scale can leave them feeling unsettled and
unsatised.

By strategically structuring your content to include a buildup and payo,
you can craft a compelling narrative that holds your audience’s attention. e
initial setup serves as a hook, generating anticipation and curiosity. is
anticipation acts as a driving force, motivating viewers to stay engaged until
the resolution is reached.
Many creators and formats rely on a powerful setup and payo dynamic to
maintain audience engagement. For example, highly successful engineering-
related creator Mark Rober always begins his videos with a teaser that includes
the nal scenes of the content. is introduction strongly suggests that he
succeeded with his experiment but encountered interesting obstacles along the
way. As viewers watch the rest of the video, they have the teaser clip in the back
of their minds, trying to gure out how everything will align for the nal
reveal, which Rober delivers in a satisfying way to complete the scale. You can
see a compelling example in his viral video Glitter Bomb 1.0 vs Porch Pirates,
which has garnered more than 89 million views.
A teaser intro is just one way to set up your audience to anticipate a
satisfying resolution. Other creators, such as TwoHotTakes, rely on the
controversy of their topics as a setup—the audience absolutely must know how
the bizarre stories end. For example, in What Would You Do If Your MIL Did
is?! Part 2 Up!, with more than 15 million views, the video shares the story
of someone whose mother-in-law tampered with her birth control, resulting in
her getting pregnant three months postpartum.
Even cute dog videos, like mayapolarbear’s e Moment She Realized It,
with more than 11.8 million views, sets up the question, “When will this dog
realize it’s being given imaginary treats?” and answers the question as part of
the resolution.
Building tension is a powerful tool for content creators to keep their
audiences engaged and eagerly awaiting the next chapter of their content.

Whether through dramatic clihangers, intriguing teasers, or compelling
setups, tension building can captivate viewers and leave them hungry for
more.
Now that we’ve explored the elements that drive content performance, let’s
shift our focus to some other marketing tactics. Let’s examine how your
marketing strategies can ensure that your messages not only reach, but truly
resonate with, your target audience.
Push Marketing vs. Pull Marketing
In the vast realm of marketing strategies, two primary approaches
frequently emerge: push marketing and pull marketing. Understanding the
distinction between these methods can signicantly optimize your marketing
eorts, but it’s crucial to note that neither approach guarantees a connection
with the audience.
Push marketing involves “pushing” your product, service, or message in
front of an audience, even if they aren’t actively seeking what you’re oering.
For instance, on social media platforms, businesses run ads that appear on
users’ feeds, regardless of whether they were actively searching for that content
or not.
Pull marketing, on the other hand, attracts customers already looking for a
product or service like yours. When someone searches for “best running shoes”
and is presented with a list of sponsored product links, that’s pull marketing in
action.
However, regardless of whether you opt for a push or pull marketing
strategy, the ultimate objective should always be genuine communication.
Simply broadcasting a message, even if tailored for the specic marketing
approach, might not guarantee engagement—hence, the importance of
understanding the dierence between marketing and communication.

Marketing vs. Communication
To eectively engage your audience, it’s essential to prioritize establishing a
connection and gaining their trust before diving into sales or promotion.
Speak to them in a language they understand, and provide value up front. In
Part III of this book, e Communication Algorithm, I’ll focus on insights to
help you better understand how to communicate most eectively across a wide
spectrum of people. Now, our focus shifts to understanding why
communication, rather than straightforward marketing, is so important.
Picture this scenario: A plastic surgeon tries to capture your attention with
a video that begins, “My goal as a practicing cosmetic and plastic surgeon is to
achieve exceptional, natural-looking results while ensuring an excellent patient
experience. My oce stands out due to its unique attributes, supported by a
dedicated team of more than 30 professionals who work with me daily. . . .”
Does this content make you want to watch further? Although it may be
informative, it lacks engagement and relatability. We recognize it as a hard
push marketing eort, and that realization immediately turns us o.
Family medicine practitioner Doctor Mike, known as @doctormike on
YouTube, uses a much more engaging approach, as illustrated in the script
below, which is inspired by his content:
Person 1: Do your patients call you Dr. Mike?
Dr. Mike: ey change it up. What were you about to say?
Person 1: I wanted to ask you, why do I sweat more than the average
person? Like right now, my seat is a swamp? No, literally. I’ve been sitting
on this paper town. Look how wet it is!
Dr. Mike: Do you want another paper towel?
Person 1: No, I’m good.

Dr. Mike: e reason people sweat is usually for thermal regulation
purposes. But you’re probably sweating more now than usual because of
your coee. [Dr. Mike points to Person 1’s coee cup.]
Person 1: I do drink it every day, but everybody drinks coee.
Dr. Mike: A lot of people do, but just know that after a cup of coee, you
sweat more. Another thing that could be going on—your metabolism
makes you run at a slightly dierent temperature. . . .
In this scenario, we witness a conversation centered around the relatable
issue of excessive sweating. is dialogue establishes an immediate connection
with the audience that builds intrigue. is connection paves the way for
viewers to be more receptive to the information shared, enhancing the overall
impact of the message.
It’s important to remember that simply marketing and promoting your
services without providing value or building a connection instantly puts up a
barrier between you and your audience. We seek connection, not overt
marketing pitches. erefore, it’s crucial to provide valuable insights before
talking about your products and services. By creating a genuine, relatable
experience, we can capture our audience’s attention and keep them engaged
throughout the journey.
Bridge Personal Passions with Popular Topics
Connecting with as many people as possible is pivotal for going viral, and
there are many ways to go about it. For instance, Charles Cornell, an internet
personality and the founder of Cornell Music Academy, takes the approach of
seamlessly weaving popular elements such as anime, cartoons, and video game
music into his music-related content. He nds unique ways to link his content
to these cultural references, such as commenting on heavy-metal music in a
video game from the perspective of a jazz pianist. is interplay of varying

interests and genres enables him to resonate with a diverse audience, a strategy
that you, too, can adopt to broaden your reach.
Illustrating this principle is Cornell’s video e INSANE Rhythm of Doom
Eternal, which amassed more than 1.1 million views. Here, he explores the
musical construction of a song from a popular video game that he’s never
heard before. By leveraging the existing fan base of the game and combining it
with his piano expertise, Cornell crafts content that resonates with both
gamers and music enthusiasts, allowing him to tap into new audiences.
e key takeaway is that bridging your personal passions with popular and
widely appealing subjects can amplify your reach and draw in new viewers. By
exploring the intersection between your passions and broader trends, you can
create content that strikes a chord with a diverse range of audiences.
Also, when watching Charles Cornell’s Piano Meme Compilation, you see
multiple storytelling layers. First and foremost, there’s the music he performs.
en, his reaction to the meme of the girl speaking in the background of the
shot adds another layer of engagement. Finally, the content is transformative
in that it takes two familiar elements—music and memes—and combines
them in an unexpectedly funny context to create a song.
Analyzing Cornell’s content in this manner oers insights into why the
video has amassed nearly 10 million views. We learn that he focuses on
providing viewers with an immersive experience and nds ways to invite them
to enjoy the world he constructs. It’s clear that he genuinely enjoys playing
music and aims to share his passion with those who may not have felt the same
type of passion before. e integration of layers, an immersive experience, and
genuine enthusiasm are noteworthy content drivers to use when developing
your own social media content.
Noticing Nuances

As mentioned earlier, there are various nuances that play a signicant role
in how we perceive a video. Now I’ll walk you through some of the most
essential nuances to consider, including lighting, pacing, cadence, energy, the
video’s capacity to create a satisfying eect on the viewer, and luck factors.
Exploring these nuances in social media content is not about passing judgment
on whether they’re good or bad, but rather, understanding the strategies and
techniques used to achieve desired eects.
Analyzing nuances allows us to gain insights into how dierent elements—
such as composition, storytelling, pacing, and visual design—contribute to the
overall impact of a piece of content. is knowledge empowers us to make
deliberate decisions when creating our own content, ensuring that it aligns
with our intended eect and that it resonates with a wide audience. By
learning from successful and unsuccessful social media content, we can
enhance our ability to create compelling and engaging content that achieves
our desired goals.
For example, the use of lighting can create dierent atmospheres. Similarly,
the composition of your shots can aect the visual dynamics and the focus of
attention within the frame. e colors you choose can convey dierent moods
or associations, and sound design can signicantly enhance the emotional
impact of your content. Although high production value isn’t essential, there’s
a caveat concerning composition and color. It’s not about having the best
lights or a fancy setup, but it is crucial to understand and thoughtfully
incorporate these nuances. By aligning them with your intended purpose, you
can produce content that resonates more powerfully with your audience.
LIGHTING
Analyzing the lighting choices in your references can provide valuable
insights into the impact and eect that dierent lighting setups can have on

the viewer. Although there’s no one-size-ts-all approach to lighting,
understanding the specic eect you want to create and studying references
can guide you in making informed lighting decisions for your content.
Consider the role of lighting in shaping the mood and atmosphere of your
videos. Bright and vibrant lighting, for example, can create a cheerful and
energetic atmosphere, while dim and moody lighting can evoke a sense of
mystery or suspense. Let’s delve deeper into how lighting choices can
contribute to a viewer’s perception.
In James Homan’s videos, the use of bright, sterile, almost lab-like
lighting serves a specic purpose. It aligns with his brand as a coee scientist,
giving his content an analytical and informative feel. is unconventional
approach to lighting in coee-related content, which typically features warm,
cozy, and rustic aesthetics, sets him apart and reinforces his unique brand
identity. You can see an example of Homan’s approach in one of his videos
titled Dalgona Coee—Explained and Upgraded.
In contrast, if you watch Teddy Baldassarre’s video An Iconic Dress Watch
Now in Green, you’ll notice a moody and cinematic lighting setup. is choice
enhances the sense of luxury and sophistication associated with the topic of
luxury watches. e play of shadows and highlights contributes to a visually
appealing and high-end presentation.
By exploring and understanding how lighting can be tailored to your
content’s theme and your brand identity, you can elevate the visual impact of
your videos. So, when considering your lighting choices, think beyond the
technical aspects; and consider how they align with the emotions, atmosphere,
and brand you wish to convey.
COMPOSITION AND COLOR

Composition and color choices can be intentional and align with the
desired eect or message of the content. In DIY videos, for instance, a neutral
and bland background allows the focus to be on the main driver of the video,
which is the clever and unexpected process being demonstrated. By avoiding
distracting and bright colors in the background, the video keeps the viewer’s
attention on the main point. An example of this approach can be found in
HGTV Handmade’s video How to Wrap a Present Perfectly Every, with 4.6
million views.
In a dierent context, such as personal nance content on YouTube, the
composition and color arrangement of a video may try to evoke a feeling of
auence and accomplishment in the viewer. e selection of a spacious
setting, accompanied by a softly blurred background, can foster a sense of ease
and credibility. e strategic placement of props such as a piano, an art
installation, a money-themed poster, and even an aspirational item like an
expensive sports car collectively contributes to the perception that the
YouTuber possesses the expertise to guide viewers toward nancial success. An
example of this strategy can be seen in Graham Stephan’s video I Sold Out.
PACING
Many people associate the concept of pacing in content creation with the
number of cuts or edits that occur within a specic time frame—be it a minute
or a few seconds. Yet, this simplied view fails to capture the true essence of
pacing. e crucial aspect to consider is not the quantity of cuts, but rather
how the information is delivered and the pace at which it unfolds. Pacing is a
nuanced interplay between content elements that guide the audience’s
experience and engagement.
For instance, imagine lming various angles of my face while I recite the
same script. If I were to mechanically repeat words without conveying any

valuable insights or progressing the narrative, the pacing would feel sluggish.
Even if I interspersed the shots with a new angle every second, resulting in 20
dierent face shots, the overall eect would be lacking. e viewer wouldn’t
gain anything substantial from the content, and the story wouldn’t advance.
An example of eective pacing can be observed in Rico Roman’s e Roman
Empire Invades Tokyo, with more than 1.1 million views.
CADENCE
Cadence refers to the rhythm and ow of speech, playing a crucial role in
eective content delivery and conveying dierent eects. Let’s examine three
examples, highlighting the dierences in vocal cadence:
1. In Techquickie’s video Why Is the Start Menu at the Bottom?, the
YouTuber has a playful and energetic vocal cadence. e delivery
feels scripted but engages the audience with a lighthearted,
conversational tone. e cadence is lively, with a quicker pace and
minimal pauses, emphasizing the fun and enjoyable nature of the
content.
2. In Mrwhosetheboss’ OnePlus 9 & 9 Pro REVIEW, the YouTuber
takes a more serious and cinematic approach. e vocal cadence
includes more pauses, allowing for a deliberate and dramatic
eect. e pace is slower, giving the audience time to absorb the
information, and it adds a sense of importance and depth to the
content.
3. Unbox erapy’s video You’ve NEVER seen a Keyboard Like is . .
. features a more casual and authentic vocal cadence. e
YouTuber speaks in a conversational manner, as if having a chat
with the viewers. e cadence feels natural and relaxed, with

pauses and a more leisurely pace. is style aims to create a
personable and relatable connection with the audience.
ese variations in vocal cadence contribute to the dierent eects and
atmospheres created in each video. e playful cadence enhances the fun and
entertainment value, the dramatic cadence adds depth and seriousness, and the
conversational cadence fosters authenticity and relatability. e choice of
cadence depends on your desired eect and the tone you wish to convey to
your audience.
ENERGY
Dynamics and changes in energy are essential components in creating
engaging and captivating content. YouTuber Mark Rober is a master at
employing dynamic changes to maintain audience interest. By shifting the
energy, visuals, and narrative focus, he eectively captures and holds viewers’
attention. Let’s look at his video World Record Domino Robot (100k Dominoes
in 24hrs), which demonstrates dynamic changes through the following
elements:
1. Introduction of the friendly robot named Dom, with a playful
and light tone.
2. Transition to a more intense and suspenseful energy, with the
music and emphasis on the project’s signicance and complexity.
3. A shift from a small idea to a big idea by challenging the human
expert and attempting to get a Guinness World Record.
4. e use of rhetorical questions to engage viewers and stimulate
their curiosity.

By incorporating these dynamic changes, Rober eectively maintains
viewer engagement and creates a more interesting and uniquely fascinating
experience.
SATISFYING TO WATCH
Satisfying content evokes sensory experiences—whether through audio,
visual, or temporal elements—which subconsciously elevate the viewer’s sense
of enjoyment. It thrives on patterns that generate a sense of completion akin
to hearing the last note of a musical scale such as “do” in “do re mi fa so la ti
do.” As a result, this type of content becomes captivating and engaging for
viewers; it taps into our inherent human tendency to seek patterns and derive
pleasure from their repetition or satisfying culmination.
Two examples of videos that are satisfying to watch include: NileRed
Shorts’ Watch is Superconductor Hover Around in Midair, which boasts more
than 40 million views; and Brainian75’s Monster Magnet Meets Magnetic Fluid,
which garnered more than 13 million views.
LUCK FACTORS
When analyzing content and searching for references, it’s wise to steer clear
of content that gained traction due to luck or the unique personality traits of a
creator. Although some creators may achieve success by possessing an appealing
personality or a fascinating way of presenting themselves, these factors aren’t
easily duplicated. A classic example of a luck-driven (and undeniably adorable)
video example is Wild Candy’s Sneezing Baby Panda, with 6.6 million views.
Instead, it’s more eective to focus on creating content that stands out
through its structure, concept, and process. By developing clear and
compelling concept, implementing an engaging structure, and showcasing a
well-dened process, you can create content that drives performance based on

its own strengths rather than relying on external factors such as celebrity status
or fortunate circumstances.
Analyze Your Own Content for Breakthrough Success
Even when your content achieves remarkable success, it’s crucial to analyze
it to identify areas for improvement. Your highest-performing content should
serve as the new benchmark for your future creations. For instance, let’s say
you had a video that performed exceptionally well, but you didn’t take the
time to understand why. In such a case, you might create another video with a
similar opening sequence, unaware that the opener was the part that didn’t
resonate with the audience. Whereas, if you had done a proper analysis, you
could have recognized that a slight adjustment in the rst few seconds would
have signicantly improved performance. Paying attention to small details like
this can lead to a dramatic increase in views, propelling your content from one
million to 20 million in no time. By continually rening and optimizing your
content based on thorough analysis, you can unlock even greater success.
Delving deep into the nuances of your content might mean posting less
often, but the trade-o can be worth it. Consider top creators such as YouTube
icons MrBeast and Mark Rober; for years when they were solo creators
without a team, they posted only once a month or even less, yet they ascended
to the pinnacle of social media stardom. Although it’s true that these creators
now have extensive production teams enabling them to produce content more
frequently, they’ve always remained committed to a core principle: it’s
paramount to create breakthrough content that reaches and deeply engages the
masses. In contrast, regularly producing content that garners little attention or
repeatedly reaches the same viewers doesn’t yield the same impact.
Avoid getting trapped in a routine, such as posting just because it’s a
particular day of the week. Before sharing any type of content, assess your

condence in its potential to truly stand out. If you’re not convinced, it might
be wise to hold o on publishing.
When your content pops up in someone’s feed, the goal is for them to
eagerly anticipate watching it—be it instantly or at some point during their
day. Delivering bland content not only risks diminishing their trust in what
you oer but can also erode the algorithm’s likelihood of promoting your
work in the future. Always strive to excite and engage, preserving both viewer
and algorithmic trust.
Navigating Content Analysis: Step by Step
FIGURE OUT WHAT’S WORKING
Let’s walk through an analysis of musically based reaction content. Even if
you’re not a musician, this analogy will be valuable in helping you understand
the process. is format features reactions to songs or music videos. In the
video we will analyze below, the creator plays both the musician(s) and a
character who reacts to the music. As the performance improves with each
iteration, the character displays funny reactions, which enhances the viewer’s
perception of the increasing quality of the music.
Our rst step is to assess the creator’s subscriber or follower count to
understand the size of their audience. en we gauge the expected
performance of their videos by looking at average view counts. Although these
numbers may vary depending on the format and the creators being analyzed,
it’s essential to establish a baseline.
For instance, if a creator typically receives 200,000 to 300,000 views per
video, you can classify these videos as their Silver Tier videos. Videos achieving
signicantly higher view counts, such as 800,000, or more than one million
views, would qualify as Gold Tier content. Videos with view counts below
100,000 fall into the Bronze Tier, or the category of underperforming videos.

It’s generally recommended to focus on content that’s one to two years old,
with a possible stretch to three years, while content older than four or ve
years is considered too old for analysis.
Once you’ve gathered this initial information, you’re ready to delve into
the mechanics of successful videos. Begin by examining the core idea behind
the content, often discernible from video titles themselves. As you explore
these titles, you’re likely to identify patterns or themes. For example, in
Charles Cornell’s music-related content on YouTube, a pattern emerged where
he created ve versions of a particular song—think “Happy Birthday” or
“Jingle Bells”—each iteration escalating the level of quality, nesse, or
complexity. In his videos, songs either progressively become a little jazzier or
evolved from a terrible to an amazing version. e birthday-related example
can be seen in his video 5 Happy Birthday Versions, Terrible to Amazing, which
garnered 9.6 million views.
e “Levels” concept—where activities, explanations, or ideas are shown in
increasing complexity or nesse—is not only used in music. It’s been
implemented across many content verticals including, food, neuroscience, and
skateboarding. When you come across a format concept that works across
dierent channels and content verticals, it indicates that it’s a promising
approach to consider for your own content creation. Top of FormBottom of
Form
A prime example of this concept in a dierent vertical can be seen in the
video e 21 Levels of Skateboarding with Tony Hawk: Easy to Complex. Hawk’s
approach of watching skateboarding footage and providing commentary on
the technique and progression creates a fascinating viewing experience. Once
you start watching, it’s dicult to stop, because you want to witness the
performance improve.

e Levels concept also has an intriguing eect on the viewer (EOV).
Content creators who incorporate this concept generally nd it to be a useful
format. It works because it oers viewers a promised eect and a journey at the
onset—they’re taken through dierent levels of performance or a skill. is is
the type of insight you want to nd when conducting your analysis.
IDENTIFY WHAT’S NOT WORKING:
A PRACTICAL APPROACH
Once you’ve analyzed successful content, shift your focus to videos that
didn’t perform as well. ese should be within the same format, whether they
are from the same creator or from dierent creators who use the same format.
e goal is to uncover the reasons behind their lackluster performance. To do
so, compare a high-performing video (referred to as a Gold video) with a low-
performing one (a Bronze video). Look for dierences in topic, structure, and
storytelling techniques. Comparing these examples side by side—which we
recommend for a clearer understanding—will help you understand what
makes content succeed or fail, enabling you to ne-tune your own strategies.
With this understanding in mind, let’s delve into the practical steps of this
analysis:
Step 1: Choose your videos: Start by selecting two videos: one that
performed well (a Gold performer), and one that did not (a Bronze
performer). For example, let’s consider two videos by Charles Cornell:
High-performing: How to Train Your Dragon Is a MASTERCLASS
in eme Writing, which amassed 1.1 million views.
Low-performing: Why You Can’t Get Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Music
Out of Your Head, which has 155,000 views.

Step 2: Analyze dierences: Note the dierences between the two videos
in terms of topic, structure, and presentation. Ask yourself:
Is the topic engaging?
Is the headline catchy?
Is the information well structured?
For example, in the low-performing video Why You Can’t Get Lin-Manuel
Miranda’s Music Out of Your Head, Cornell talks about the music from the
movie Moana. Start your analysis with questions such as: “Is Moana an
uninteresting topic for the masses?,” “Is the headline too vague?,” and “Could
the video’s structure be improved?”
Step 3: Conrm through comparison: To conrm your initial
observations, look at a video from the same creator that performed well and
tackles a similar topic, leveraging the same format. For example, How to Train
Your Dragon Is a MASTERCLASS in eme Writing is also about an animated
lm and achieved high viewership. is comparison indicates that the topic of
an animated lm is engaging enough. e distinction is that, in this high-
performing video, Cornell used a more eective headline by including the
name of the movie in the title. is choice likely appealed to the masses,
compared to the less successful Bronze video, which specically mentioned
composer Lin-Manuel Miranda. en, move on to analyze the next key
dierence and continue until you’ve reviewed all the distinctions between the
Gold and Bronze videos.
Step 4: Test your hypotheses: Finally, validate your observations by
comparing them against additional low-performing videos to see if your
hypotheses hold up. Check to see if the issues you’ve identied are consistent.
Final Thoughts

By carefully dissecting what sets high-performing videos apart from low-
performing ones, you’ll be better equipped to create content that resonates
with your audience.
EXERCISE: ANALYZING YOUR GSB SHEET
WITH NEW AWARENESS
Practice makes perfect! With the insights and understanding you’ve gained
in this chapter, revisit the GSB (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) analysis sheet you
made at the end of chapter 2. Or nd a new creator or format that inspires
you, and follow these steps:
1. Determine follower size: Begin by looking at the creator’s
subscriber or follower count to gauge the size of their audience.
2. Identify performance baseline: Observe the expected
performance per post. You want to nd a baseline for
understanding the typical views the creator receives.
3. Select Silver videos: Choose at least 5 videos that fall within the
typical view count for the creator or account, which can be
considered Silver Tier content.
4. Analyze Gold performers: Identify at least 5 breakout, top-
performing Gold videos that have signicantly outperformed
typical view counts.
5. Study Bronze videos: Choose at least 5 low-performing Bronze
videos to analyze. is allows you to draw meaningful insights
from both ends of the performance spectrum.
6. Identify patterns: Look for patterns or commonalities in the
Gold and Bronze videos separately. Are there any noticeable
trends or dierences in content topic, opening sequences,

storytelling techniques, energy levels, lighting, transitions, or
other factors?
7. Formulate hypotheses: Based on your observations, formulate
hypotheses about why the Gold videos outperform the Bronze
ones. Pay attention to how the story is being told and the EOV.
ese factors are often the most inuential drivers of success.
8. Validate hypotheses: Test your hypotheses about what drives
performance in Gold videos by cross-referencing them with the
low-performing Bronze videos. If one of your hypotheses about a
top performance driver is found in a low-performing video, you
need to go back to the drawing board. Otherwise, you can use the
insights about the potential success drivers to inuence the
ideation and creation process, which we will dive into in chapter
4.
By following these steps, you will gain insight into the factors that
contribute to content success or failure. is approach identies eective
storytelling, engagement drivers, and resonating elements, helping optimize
your content strategy. Each time you practice this exercise, you will get closer
to becoming a viral sensation!
AN EXAMPLE OF PERFORMANCE DRIVERS DERIVED FROM A
THRIFT VLOGGING ANALYSIS
To guide you in formulating your own hypotheses, I’ll share some that my
team developed while deeply analyzing thrift vlogging content on platforms
such as Instagram and TikTok. rift vlogging is a type of video content
where creators share their experiences of shopping at thrift stores or
secondhand shops. ese vlogs often showcase the process of sifting through

items, nding unique or valuable pieces, discussing the prices, and sometimes
even oering tips on how to shop at thrift stores eectively. After the shopping
experience, thrift vloggers may also include a “haul” segment, where they show
and discuss all the items they purchased. Example creators in this genre include
“deathbythifting” or “peachstatevtg” on TikTok. An example with more than
four million views from “peachstatevtg” is Gotta Love $20 rift Hauls.
Although these performance drivers were identied within the specic
niche of thrift vlogging, they oer a broader resonance and serve as universal
principles applicable to various content domains:
Ensure clarity in communication: rift vloggers emphasize
concise information delivery. Regardless of the content domain, it’s
imperative to ensure that your message is lucid and directly
conveyed.
Highlight the value proposition: Showcase the unique benets or
value of what you’re presenting—be it a product, idea, or story.
Maintain focus: Avoid excessive camera ipping; stay on topic and
eliminate unnecessary distractions.
Create a sense of urgency: Craft your content to feel timely and
immediately relevant.
Add an interactive element: Incorporate commentary with
dialogue throughout your videos.
Ensure relatability: Be certain that your audience sees themselves
and their world in your content.
Establish authority and expertise: Gleaned from vloggers sharing
insights about thrifted items, position yourself as a trustworthy
source by oering expertise on your subject.

Build authentic emotion: rift vloggers express genuine
excitement over their nds. Similarly, let your true feelings shine
through, whatever your content topic.
Insert an educational or value-added component: As thrift
vloggers oer styling tips, always aim to provide added value or
educational insights in your content.
By understanding and applying these foundational drivers within this
format, content creators in any vertical can signicantly boost their social
media presence and engagement rates.
CASE STUDY: HOW JOHN MALECKI TURNED A PASSION FOR
WOODWORKING INTO A THRIVING BUSINESS
Introduction: John Malecki, a former Pittsburgh Steelers oensive lineman,
had a passion for woodworking but faced the challenge of transitioning into
this new career. A targeted social media strategy helped him turn his
woodworking hobby into a successful business.
Background: Malecki made a signicant career transition to pursue his love
for woodworking and DIY projects. Despite his expertise, he struggled to
eectively communicate his excitement and capture the attention of others.
Recognizing Malecki’s potential, we stepped in to assist him in developing a
robust social media presence to promote his DIY business coaching course,
“Craft to Career.”
Challenge: e primary challenge Malecki faced was nding ways to engage
and captivate a large audience around the niche of woodworking. He needed
assistance in standing out among the vast sea of DIY content creators and
reaching the masses to promote his coaching course eectively.

Solution: To address Malecki’s unique needs, we crafted a social media strategy
specically designed to create content that captivates the masses. Malecki used
a Viral Format called “Testing Viral Hacks,” and further enhanced his content
by layering elements like ASMR. is approach not only showcased his
expertise but also transformed each video into an immersive experience.
Furthermore, Malecki’s “impossible” projects serve as a compelling Hook
Point, or concept used to grab the audience’s attention quickly and eectively
in the shortest amount of time possible. He draws viewers in with the
implausible nature of tasks, such as building a bookcase from a single sheet of
plywood. is unbelievable premise and Hook Point captivates viewers as he
experiments to see if these feats can be accomplished. By focusing on these
dynamic projects, he has established a compelling Hook Point that paves the
way for a distinctive brand identity.
ree crucial elements were interwoven into his content: absurdity, clever
problem-solving, and a dose of his personal struggles and personality.
Together, these components served as signicant performance drivers. Malecki
was set on a path to tackle unexpected challenges, each governed by its unique
set of “rules.” A pivotal part of this format was its explorative nature, allowing
the audience to join Malecki on his journey—witnessing his trials, errors, and
innovative solutions.
To heighten the experience further, the importance of drama and
cinematic sequences was underscored. Also, some innovative content ideas
were proposed, such as crafting a table using only tools from a dollar store,
taking on projects with items solely from wish.com, and a playful challenge
where Malecki’s signicant other would construct something by following his
guidelines without him touching the tools.
In addition, the application of the Communication Algorithm, detailed in
Part III of this book, empowered Malecki to forge a more genuine connection

with his target audience.
Results:
Following this strategy led to signicant growth on Malecki’s social media
platforms. His average video views increased dramatically, from 100,000 to
over a million, and his collective video view count now exceeds 150 million.
Part of his success came from experimenting with various Viral Formats,
optimizing thumbnails, and capitalizing on viral TikTok woodworking hacks,
all of which allowed him to reach a signicantly wider audience.
In his breakout videos, Malecki strategically incorporated ASMR elements,
tackled seemingly impossible challenges, and layered absurdity in his

storytelling (discussed in chapter 5). ese key performance drivers were
instrumental in driving the outstanding results he achieved.
EXAMPLES OF BEFORE AND AFTER CONTENT
Before:
ULTIMATE Shop Storage Cabinet Build, with 133,000 views is a good example
of Malecki’s content before implementing the strategies you’re learning in this
book.
After:

e video Testing Viral Woodworking TikToks Again . . . , with more than 1.6
million views, is a good example of Malecki’s content after implementing the
Viral Content Model. Remember, this video and all other videos and
references shared throughout the book can be viewed at
http://guide.hookpoint.com/.
Conclusion: Malecki’s story serves as a reminder that with the right approach,
even niche subjects can connect with the masses online. Eective social media
strategies can amplify unique skills and attract a larger, more engaged
audience.
Recommendations: Companies or individuals facing challenges in reaching a
wider audience can learn from Malecki’s case. By focusing on nding a Viral
Format that resonates and understanding the mechanics of eective

communication, it’s possible to grow an online presence and monetize
expertise.

CHAPTER 4
THE CREATIVITY BLUEPRINT:
STRATEGIC IDEATION IN ACTION
After conducting thorough research and identifying a Viral Format that aligns
with your brand’s or business’s needs, the next step is to develop content ideas.
It’s essential to understand that the strength of a format lies in the quality of
the ideas it contains. e real challenge—and opportunity—begins at this
stage: generating impactful ideas to use within your chosen format.
e ideation process, which is essentially the generation and development
of new ideas, empowers you to prioritize these concepts through evidence-
based decision-making. Unlike traditional approaches that may involve
latching on to the rst idea that comes to mind and investing time, energy,
and money only to see it fail, this method is dierent. Guided by the research
and analysis components of the Viral Content Model, it encourages you to
explore a wide range of potential concepts. By constructing an expansive
catalog of ideas, you can compare, evaluate, and ultimately rank them. is
ensures that you invest your time and resources in the most impactful and
compelling ideas.
Central to this process is a deceptively simple yet powerful tool: the
Ideation Sheet. is resource oers a dedicated space for capturing and
evaluating your ideas. By diligently documenting your creativity within this
framework, you generate a valuable resource that can be revisited, rened, and
expanded over time.

e Ideation Sheet transforms into a canvas for your imagination,
anchored by scientic insight. It lets you brainstorm and explore various
possibilities—enhanced by your newfound understanding of performance
drivers, formats, nuances, and storytelling formats. It encourages you to think
outside the box, challenge conventional thinking, and expand your capacity
for creating viral content.
Remember, this process is not solely about idea generation; it’s also about
fostering a culture of continual improvement. By constantly revisiting and
rening your ideas, you ensure that each piece of content you produce is
infused with breakthrough potential.
The Importance of Chaos in Ideation
During your brainstorming sessions, welcome the chaos, and dive into
unconventional ideas, drawing inspiration from diverse industries. Avoid
conning yourself to tried-and-true approaches. Instead, push the envelope,
even if some ideas initially feel “way too crazy.”
Don’t xate on the status quo—reach for the stars! By going beyond
traditional boundaries, you open yourself to a reservoir of untapped creativity
and innovation. Remember, you can always backtrack and tone down your
ideas later on. But venturing into uncharted territories, you may discover
hidden gems and groundbreaking concepts.
100 to 1: Generating More Ideas Than Necessary
Embrace the strategy of generating a multitude of ideas. Aim for a high
ratio, like generating 100 ideas for every one you’ll nalize. is emphasis on
quantity allows for a wider exploration of possibilities and increases the
chances of discovering unique and innovative concepts.
When you feel like you’ve exhausted your ideas and reached a point where
you “can’t think of any more,” don’t give up. is is often the moment when

new patterns and directions emerge. Push through the initial barrier and
stretch your creative limits.
It’s also important to take a step back and evaluate your ideas critically.
Look for patterns and themes that may indicate an overemphasis on a
particular direction while neglecting other potentially valuable avenues. A
balanced exploration of perspectives and possibilities is essential.
e creative process often requires repeated cycles of ideation and
renement. By continually generating ideas, exploring dierent directions,
and embracing new patterns, you increase your chances of arriving at a truly
impactful and original concept. Embrace the journey of exploration, and
remain open to the unexpected paths it presents.
Using Hook Points to Amplify Your Ideas
Occasionally, an idea for a video might be decent but lacks a compelling
hook to truly shine. It’s possible to rejuvenate an overused concept by coming
up with an appealing Hook Point. Remember, a Hook Point refers to a
concept used to grab the audience’s attention quickly and eectively. It’s
designed to capture interest in the shortest amount of time possible, ensuring
that viewers are immediately engaged. is tool is crucial for standing out in a
crowded social media landscape, where the ability to draw viewers in from the
rst glance can determine the success of content. Consider Mindvalley’s
Vishen Lakhiani and his morning-routine video as an example.
Initially, a morning-routine video sounds generic and overdone. But to
amplify its appeal, my team came up with a unique angle. In the video,
Lakhiani shares a thought-provoking statement: “Saving 15 hours a week saves
60 hours a month, which is 720 hours a year, or 30 extra days of your life that
are given back to you every year.” is powerful Hook Point, emphasizing the

idea of reclaiming days of one’s life, instantly captivates viewers, pulling them
into Lakhiani’s daily routine.
To capitalize on the Hook Point about saving time, we titled the video
How to Gain Back 15 Hours a Week with ese Smart Hacks (this video and all
other videos throughout the book can be viewed at
http://guide.hookpoint.com/). is strategy distinguishes it from the multitude
of generic morning-routine videos, which often have ineective titles such as 5
Ways to Be More Productive in Your Workday. In contrast, the title How to Gain
Back 15 Hours a Week with ese Smart Hacks not only oers a fresh
perspective but also provides a compelling reason for viewers to engage with
the content.
is example illustrates the power of a well-crafted Hook Point in
transforming an overused concept into a video that not only captivates but
also resonates with a wide audience. It serves as a reminder of the crucial
importance of nding unique angles and hooks to dierentiate your content
in an overcrowded digital space. For a deeper dive into crafting eective
hooks, check out my book Hook Point: How to Stand Out in a 3-Second World.
QUICK TIPS FOR IDEA GENERATION
Before we dive into how to use the Ideation Sheet, let’s revisit some quick
tips for generating great ideas:
1. Address a fresh audience: During brainstorming sessions,
visualize an audience that doesn’t know or care about your subject
matter. is mindset helps you craft content that appeals to new
potential viewers, rather than relying solely on existing fans. An
exercise we practice is “How would you make this video
interesting to your mother or grandparent?” We even have some

clients that ask their loved ones which video subject or title they
would be more likely to watch.
2. Tap into popular topics: Anchor your ideas to subjects already in
the limelight. Associating your content with current hot topics
(such as trending TV shows, movies, common problems people
are addressing, renowned celebrities, hit music, etc.) increases the
potential of drawing a larger audience. When working with Katie
Couric, I would often go to Google News or Google Trends, type
in the subject or person we were covering, and see which hooks or
stories were trending.
3. Avoid industry jargon: When crafting your ideas, steer clear of
using industry-specic language. Instead, opt for words and
phrases that resonate with the masses, making your content more
accessible and appealing to a wider range of viewers.
4. Seek strong references: Use the Gold, Silver, and Bronze (GSB)
research process to nd and base your ideas on strong references.
If you nd reference videos that have achieved high performance,
it’s a great indication of your idea’s potential. Drawing inspiration
from references, especially as you’re learning this process, will
greatly increase your chances of producing impactful content.
Filling Out the Ideation Sheet
Let’s walk through the process of lling out the Ideation Sheet. Before we
get started, look at this example of a lled-out sheet:

You’ll begin with a blank Ideation Sheet:

If you’d like to access a lled-out and a blank Ideation Sheet template, you can
do so here: http://guide.hookpoint.com/.
Now, let’s walk through lling out each section of the Ideation Sheet:
IDEAS SECTION
is segment captures the overall concept of your video. Aim to come up
with at least 20 initial ideas, though you can develop up to 100. When
formulating the video concept, strive for conciseness—limit yourself to one or
two sentences to create a succinct snapshot that encapsulates the main idea for
quick comprehension. You can later elaborate on each concept, adding
intricate details as needed.
When generating ideas, it’s wise to draw inspiration from high-performing
Gold reference videos. For instance, if you analyzed MrBeast’s $1 vs
$10,000,000 Yacht! on your GSB sheet, you can adapt its format by
substituting the word Yacht with a placeholder: $1 vs $10,000,000 “X”! is

can then be customized to your topic, such as jewelry or art: $1 vs
$10,000,000 Ring! or $1 vs $10,000,000 Painting!
Similarly, if you encountered How to Make Homemade Plant Food with Just
2 Ingredients by Creative Explained, take the core format: How to Make
Homemade Plant Food with Just 2 Ingredients, remove the topic-specic words,
and you’re left with a template: How to Make “X” with “Just X.”
Here’s a visual of how this works, with additional examples:

e goal is to generate concepts that grab people’s attention in the shortest
possible amount of time. Remember to integrate core performance drivers
identied during your research and analysis. Don’t hesitate to think big! Even
if an idea seems too ambitious or resource intensive, include it. You can later
scale it down to a more manageable version. Let your creativity run wild, and
enjoy the brainstorming process!
REFERENCE LINKS SECTION
Having high-performing video references for each concept not only serves
as a potent source of inspiration but also provides a structural blueprint that
makes the production process much easier. It’s crucial to keep these references
handy, so consider adding the links directly into your Ideation Sheet. at
way, you can quickly revisit them, draw insights, and add unique elements into
your content as you create your videos.
NOTES SECTION
Use the notes section to jot down pertinent details. Include insights that
remind you of what stands out in a reference or elements you’d like to
replicate. For example, you could point out a time stamp in the reference link,
a specic moment you want to include, or anything else you feel is important.
ese notes will oer clarity and direction as you transition into the execution
phase.
RANKING AND ASSESSING YOUR IDEAS
In the nal stage of the creative process, after coming up with a ton of
ideas, it’s time to rank and evaluate them using a quick and . . . well, ruthless
approach. Follow these steps to eectively assess and prioritize your ideas:

1. Rate each idea: Using a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 signies top-
notch and 5 is the least appealing, quickly rate each idea. Rely on
your gut feeling, which stems from your knowledge of what
works and what doesn’t on social media, to assess their potential
success. If you’re generating ideas based on a format you’ve
researched, also rank them based on the drivers you identied
during that research. Treat each idea as a Hook Point (or
headline), without diving deep into extensive explanations or
attempting to restructure it. Give the idea a 1 if:
a. It is rich in detail.
b. It has a good reference from a strong creator (someone
with a track record of generating substantial views).
c. Is easy to visualize with a clear narrative.
If, on the other hand, it’s vague and generic, lacks an interesting Hook
Point, and doesn’t have a clear narrative structure, give it a 5. Ideas that
have potential but are not yet rened score between a 2 and a 4,
depending on the tweaks required to strengthen them.
Example:
“Outts for travel” would be a 5.
“Outts to wear on a ve-hour plane ride” might be positioned
at a 3.
“Outts inspired by e Little Mermaid” would claim a 1.
2. Prioritize your highest-rated ideas: Focus your attention on the
ideas that you ranked as a 1. ese represent the concepts with the
highest potential for breakthrough performance. When you’re

just starting out, it’s smart to focus on the top-rated ideas that also
have strong references. is strategy gives you the option of
emulating and learning from proven storytelling techniques and
drivers.
3. Workshop your top pick: Once you’ve identied a top-rated idea
full of potential, develop it further. Dedicate time to expand
upon it. Brainstorm variations, consider dierent angles, and
revisit or broaden your reference pool. Do whatever you need to
do to enhance the appeal and impact of the concept.
4. Embrace the learning journey: Remember, this ranking and
vetting process isn’t just about producing great ideas; it’s also
about evolving as a creator. As you analyze your content’s
performance, make adjustments, and adapt, you’ll sharpen your
skills and ne-tune your understanding of what drives an idea’s
success.
5. Adapt and rene as you go: Keep in mind that your initial
rankings aren’t set in stone. As you gain experience and gather
insights by posting your content, don’t hesitate to revisit and
adjust some concepts, even those you initially deemed less
promising. Always nd ways to improve and enhance your ideas.
By following this process, you’ll prioritize high-potential ideas, dive deep
with research and analysis, and consistently rene your concepts to create
impactful content that truly resonates.
SAYING NO (A LOT) TO MEDIOCRE IDEAS
When you treat each piece of content as if your life depends on it, you
establish a mindset of continual improvement and a dedication to excellence.

To solidify an eective idea-vetting process, consider the following guidelines:
1. Prioritize research-driven insights: Base your content decisions
on solid research and data, not personal preferences or biases. For
instance, if evidence indicates that recognizable characters and
well-known brands resonate more with audiences, then opt for
making videos where they’ll be featured over those lesser-known
niche brands. It’s essential that every idea you pursue is rooted in
objective analysis, ensuring both its relevance and potential for
success.
2. Embrace brutal evaluation: If you work on a team, avoid the
pitfall of team members supporting each other’s ideas simply to
please one another. Encourage a culture of critical thinking and
healthy debate where ideas are thoroughly examined and
evaluated based on their merit. Challenge assumptions, ask
probing questions, and be willing to constructively critique ideas
to ensure that only the strongest concepts move forward.
3. Promote insightful feedback: Instead of simply saying, “I don’t
like it,” articulate specic reasons when expressing reservations
about an idea. Phrases like “I don’t think this will work because it
doesn’t promise value for the viewer,” or “I don’t think this will
work due to the lack of opportunity to subvert expectations” are
more constructive. By pinpointing specic concerns, or the
reasons why an idea may not be viable, you foster a productive
environment that leads to stronger decision-making.
4. Adopt a high-stakes mindset: Treat each piece of content as if its
value is crucial to your reputation and success. Anticipate
potential pitfalls and challenges that could arise, and use research

and data to vet your ideas thoroughly. is mindset prioritizes
excellence and ensures that your content meets the highest
standards.
5. Avoid settling for “good enough”: Especially when you’re still
building experience, always elevate the quality and impact of your
work by leveraging insights from the research and analysis process
detailed in this book. Don’t wing it.
By adhering to these principles, you create a culture of evidence-based
decision-making, critical evaluation, and constructive feedback. is ensures
that only the most promising ideas are selected and developed, increasing the
likelihood of success in creating viral content.
Creating Addictive Content
Creating addictive content is crucial for building a loyal and engaged
audience. e aim should always be to produce videos that audiences will
binge-watch, building viewers’ trust that each release will be both compelling
and enjoyable.
To maintain this trust, it’s essential to avoid releasing videos that are,
frankly, dull. Ideally, each video should be addicting, leaving viewers eagerly
awaiting the next. e ultimate compliment from your audience is: “I love
every one of your videos.”
When brainstorming content ideas, it’s essential to balance what excites
you with concepts that appeal to a wide audience. Brands such as Yes eory
serve as a prime example, consistently delivering captivating content. eir
strategy often revolves around the theme of stepping outside of one’s comfort
zone, regardless of the video’s specic topic. Whether it’s about Traveling to the
Least Visited Country in the World, Asking a Stranger to Go on a Date across the

World, or an Abandoned City In America with No Laws, what captivates their
audience is an engaging narrative style, not just the subject itself.
Building trust and creating addictive content can be likened to being a
renowned chef. If customers love a chef ’s signature style, they’ll anticipate
excellence in every dish, even if the menu changes weekly. In the same vein,
strive to be a sought-after content creator online, consistently delivering
content that delights and meets viewer expectations.
When ideating and creating, ensure that each concept has the potential to
be breakthrough content. If an idea feels mediocre or lacks the spark to
captivate an audience, invest more time in rening it. It’s better to postpone a
release to ensure quality rather than rush . . . and risk diminishing your brand’s
value.
In the end, the objective is to build a dedicated and enthusiastic following
that trusts your storytelling approach and consistently returns for more.
Concentrating on creating addicting content that resonates with a wide
audience will leave a lasting impact in the world of digital media.
Set Plays vs. Triangle (aka Structured Consistency vs. Adaptive
Strategy)
e dierence between Set Plays and the Triangle in basketball serves as a
great metaphor for the ideation and decision-making processes. Set Plays can
be likened to a golfer’s systematic routine—waking up early, getting dressed,
eating breakfast, driving to the golf course, and then playing golf—regardless
of external factors. is structured approach works well when the situation is
predictable and a consistent outcome is expected.
On the other hand, the Triangle approach, inspired by basketball coach
Phil Jackson’s oense strategy, embodies adaptability and situational awareness.
It involves considering multiple factors before deciding. For example, before
playing golf, golfers may scan the weather—assessing if it’s sunny, cloudy, or

windy—prior to deciding whether or not to play. is exible approach allows
them to make informed decisions based on ever-changing variables.
In ideation, the Triangle philosophy tends to be more fruitful. Rather than
being xated on a specic idea from the start, it’s essential to consider various
factors and potential challenges before committing to a particular concept. Just
as you wouldn’t play golf when it’s windy and rainy, you may need to shift
focus from an initial idea if it doesn’t align well with the current circumstances
or possesses signicant challenges.
An evaluation of ideas should go beyond mere acceptability. It’s essential to
strive for excellence and consider concepts that have greater potential and
fewer obstacles. Although an idea may be appealing or your favorite, if another
concept performs better and checks more boxes, it’s wise to channel your
energy into the more promising option.
Embracing the Triangle approach to ideation ensures that you remain
adaptable and make informed decisions. is mindset allows for more
exibility and creative problem-solving, leading to the development of
breakthrough content that resonates deeply with your audience.

CASE STUDY: REFINING MINDVALLEY’S
SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY WITH HOOK POINT’S MASTERY IN
VIRAL CONTENT
Introduction: Mindvalley, a pioneer in educational technology, observed that
their online engagement had plateaued despite a signicant following on social

media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. e Mindvalley team,
including founder Vishen Lakhiani and former CMO Alessio Pieroni, aimed

CHAPTER 5
THE ART OF STORYTELLING:
CAPTURING AND KEEPING
AUDIENCE ATTENTION

Now that you’ve brainstormed some promising ideas, the next phase involves
rening them for eective execution using rst-rate storytelling techniques.
Our minds are naturally drawn to stories. is chapter will guide you in
developing compelling storylines that hook your audience from the beginning
and keep them engaged till the end. e aim is to oer genuine value—
whether through informative insights or entertainment.
Imagine typical viewers scrolling through their social media feeds. Your
content should capture their attention instantly with a uniquely interesting
introduction and a rewarding payo. Ultimately, you want to leave your
audience feeling satised, reecting, I’m glad I watched that.
Eective Communication Hierarchy
To capture your audience’s attention, keep your message clear and concise.
Rather than bombarding them with an overload of information, present only
what’s essential. For instance, if using captions or title cards, it’s crucial to select
a readable font size and style. Give your viewers time to absorb the
information, and avoid overwhelming them with too much or boring them
with too little.
A visual hierarchy is equally crucial. It ensures clarity in your message,
leaving no essential detail unnoticed. To achieve this aim, steer clear of
cluttered backgrounds or distracting colors. In your videos, emphasize the
primary subjects—whether they’re people, objects, or actions—to highlight
them and make them easily visible.
Since your video will encompass various elements, it’s crucial to prioritize
them. Determine which aspects should be emphasized (and at what moments)
and which can be made less signicant. By doing so, you allow the most
important elements to take center stage.

Communication Design
e best designers disappear—not in a literal sense, of course, but in their
approach to designing content. When someone watches your video, their
attention should be on the content’s essence, not on the details of how it was
created. e aim is for the visual design to blend with the content’s intention
so seamlessly that it seems almost nonexistent.
Consider the subtlety of a lm score. If a movie’s music stands out to the
point that viewers say, “Wow! at’s beautiful music,” it distracts them from
the intended emotional impact of the scene and defeats the music’s purpose.
Although as creators, we want our work to be recognized, it shouldn’t be at the
expense of overshadowing the narrative or message.
In essence, the goal is to achieve a harmonious balance: Design elements
support and enhance the content’s purpose without demanding unwarranted
spotlight. By focusing on creating resonant, impactful content, you ensure
that your work is appreciated for its intended eect.
Here are some top tips for communication design:
EMPHASIZE LINEAR COMMUNICATION
Focus on conveying one message at a time to ensure clarity. Your visuals
and audio should work together cohesively, just like in a gym setting. Imagine
having a trainer guide you: for an eective workout, you’d want to focus on
one exercise at a time. If the trainer started explaining the next three exercises
while you were still on the rst, it would be overwhelming and confusing. A
common mistake among new social media creators is overloading their videos
with captions, title cards, movement, and dialogue simultaneously. is
sensory overload can disorient viewers—they don’t know where to focus and
feel left behind—making them more likely to scroll past.
START WITH YOUR INTENDED EFFECT

Begin with the emotional reaction you want to elicit from your audience,
and reverse-engineer from there. Instead of beginning with your message and
trying to make it t, zero in on the emotions you want to invoke in your
viewers. Bear in mind that sometimes your intended message might need a
tweak if research suggests it won’t resonate as expected.
BE GOOD, NOT DIFFERENT
Drawing a parallel between “being dierent” and “being good” is similar to
dierentiating between art and design. Art thrives on personal expression, a
realm where there’s no concrete right or wrong. Whether it manifests as a
distinctive brushstroke on canvas or a bold fashion choice, art celebrates
individual vision and creativity.
Conversely, design is anchored in solving specic problems. When
designing something like a landing page, the overriding concern is
functionality, leading to questions such as, “How can I streamline the
purchasing process for users?” Identifying these issues paves the way for
innovative solutions.
When it comes to content creation, the approach leans more toward design
than art. Although there’s room for personal avor, the heart of content
creation revolves around problem-solving. While everyone has dierent tastes,
good content sticks to certain principles to achieve its goals.
MAKE UNSAID PROMISES AND CAPTURE ATTENTION
To eectively create content, it’s crucial to grab your audience’s attention
right o the bat. Many newcomers on social platforms begin videos with bland
introductions such as, “Hi, my name is X, and today we’ll talk about fabric
softeners.” is can come across as dull and disengaging and risks losing viewer
interest.

To truly engage, the initial seconds of a video must captivate viewers. It’s all
about promising entertainment up front and then consistently delivering on
it. Take MrBeast’s video previews as an example. Ever since YouTube rolled out
mini preview trailers that appear as you scroll over a thumbnail, MrBeast and
his team have dedicated countless hours to crafting these previews. eir aim?
To immediately hook viewers, compelling them to watch the entire video. I’d
suggest checking out a few of his mini previews on YouTube for inspiration.
I-You vs. You-All
In the digital age, content consumption is primarily a solitary experience.
One of the most impactful things I learned from working with Taylor Swift is
that behind every screen, there’s usually just one individual watching your
content, not a collective audience. Whether on smartphones, computers, or
other devices, most people consume digital content alone.
is solitary consumption pattern makes the “I” to “you” communication
approach most eective. Addressing the audience as “you” establishes a
personalized and direct connection with the viewer. It feels as if you’re having
a one-on-one conversation, eliminating the barrier of the screen between the
two of you.
Steer clear of generic phrases like “Hello, everyone” or “Hey, guys.” ese
can lessen the personal feel you’re aiming for. Instead, use language that feels
natural and conversational, as though you’re having a casual dialogue with a
friend. is not only enhances viewer engagement but also builds a stronger
bond with your audience.
By directly addressing the individuals behind the screen, you convey
appreciation for their time and engagement. It communicates that you’re
speaking directly to them and care about their experience, which makes them
more likely to resonate deeply with your content.

Don’t Listen to Your Audience
“If I had asked them what they wanted,
they would have said faster horses.” — Henry Ford
As content creators, we must nd a balance between valuing our audience’s
feedback and understanding that they don’t always know their true
preferences. Our role is to make people care and oer appealing experiences,
drawing both from data and our own instincts. ose without a grasp of social
media research or algorithm nuances may not provide helpful insights.
Audience feedback—even if loud and insistent—can be misleading. is is
because the primary objective of many viewers is to voice their opinions,
rather than elevate the content’s quality. For example, consider the case of Alex
Stemp, a renowned street and portrait photographer known for approaching
random strangers on the street and oering them professional photo shoots.
Stemp creates engaging videos detailing captivating stories behind his chance
encounters, strategically withholding the nal shots until the end. Stemp
shared with me that, despite numerous viewer requests to unveil the photos
early on, his videos continue to rake in millions of views. Interestingly, when
Stemp did comply with these demands, showcasing the photographs from the
outset, those videos underperformed. e suspense generated by postponing
the photo reveal is a crucial element driving the success of his series. As such,
when navigating feedback on your content, approach comments with caution,
and discern which ones align with your vision rather than accommodating
each request.
Additionally, creating a page lled with compelling content that explores
unconventional topics can still lead to success. Consider the engaging videos
by Tom Scott, in which he explores unique topics such as the practical uses of
monorails or the volume of helium necessary to lift a person. ese aren’t
trending topics that the average person thinks about daily, nor are they ones

commonly requested by viewers. Yet it is precisely because they move beyond
conventional thinking that they work.
is isn’t an advocacy for disregarding audience feedback entirely, but a
reminder that as creators, our role is to lead, innovate, and sometimes
challenge expectations. Continue to conduct thorough research, and utilize the
Viral Content Model to craft outstanding content. Present stories that are
intriguing, foster trust, and are compelling. Invite your viewers to go on an
enticing adventure with you, as that’s the key to generating intrigue and
building a dedicated following.
When inviting them, the pitch isn’t “Here’s what you asked for,” but
“Would you like to discover something captivating with me?”
Remember, your audience consists of consumers, not professional content
creators. ey know how to care, but they don’t necessarily know how to
make others care. Trust your instincts and expertise in content creation, as that
is your area of specialization, not theirs. Besides, if you seek growth, marketing
solely to your existing audience isn’t the most eective strategy for driving
consistent virality. Expand your horizons, venture into the unexplored, and
reach out to a wider audience, transcending the connes of your current
following.
Think Like Your Audience
inking like your audience is a powerful strategy for eective
communication and marketing. To connect with your audience on a deep
level, it’s essential to speak in the language that resonates with them, and not
merely stick to traditional marketing jargon. is means balancing formal
language with colloquial language, echoing the voice they naturally hear in
their own thoughts.

To avoid being tone-deaf and to truly connect with your audience,
immerse yourself in their world and learn their language. Familiarize yourself
with their unique phrases, expressions, and thought processes. Approach
content from their perspective so you can create content that feels genuine,
authentic, and personal.
One technique is to add a touch of commentary into your messaging.
Instead of crafting overly polished and logical marketing copy, infuse your
content with the logic you’d use in your own head. Avoid sounding like a
traditional marketer who follows a script. Instead, speak and write in a way
that feels natural and conversational, as if you’re sharing a casual internal
monologue.
A perfect example of this approach is showcased in e Food eorists’
video titled Food eory: Don’t Order ese Chicken Sandwiches! e video
dissects the marketing tactics of Popeyes and Chick-l-A concerning their
chicken sandwiches. In August of 2019, Popeyes launched their take on the
chicken sandwich. Chick-l-A tweeted a seemingly harmless but slightly
passive-aggressive, corporate-sounding jab at Popeyes, which read: “Bun plus
chicken plus pickles, equals all the love for the original.” While it’s well written
and checks all the traditional marketing boxes, it was detrimental to business.
In a stroke of brilliance, Popeyes retorted with a familiar Southern expression:
“Y’all good?” is didn’t sound like an ad; it echoed the colloquial thoughts of
a Southerner. Garnering 20 billion impressions, this tweet was valued at
approximately $220 million. Consequently, Popeyes’ chicken sandwich sales
skyrocketed, and they even ran out of chicken sandwich supplies. Upon
restocking in November, sales were o the charts. In turn, Chick-l-A
suddenly found itself, for the rst time ever, in second position for chicken
sandwich sales.

e lesson here is clear: To connect with your audience, use language and
tones that mirror your audience’s internal dialogue. Speak as though you’re in
a face-to-face chat, facilitating deeper connection and brand engagement.
Popeyes’ social media triumph teaches the power of authenticity over the
traditional marketing playbook. Such genuine and relatable communication
strategies can amplify marketing success.
Additionally, to gain a deeper understanding of the language used on
platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, observe top-
performing creators. By understanding how these platforms function, you can
better align your content with their ecosystems, positioning you as an insider
instead of just another marketer trying to break in.
Start with the Desired Eect
In content creation, the key is to prioritize the subconscious reaction over
conscious understanding. Viewers feel the emotional impact of a piece rst
and process the experience in words later on. e true power of the story is
elicited by the emotional response it generates.
Rather than starting with a message and then guring out how to present it
in an interesting fashion, reverse-engineer the process: Decide on the emotions
you want viewers to experience—whether it’s awe, surprise, or wonder. Aim
for reactions such as, “Oh my God, that is so cool!,” “Why didn’t I think of
that?,” “I can’t believe that’s possible,” or “I’ve never seen it that way . . . wow!”
If you can’t identify the precise emotional eect you want to produce in
your audience, it’s best not to proceed with its creation. Begin with the end in
mind: the desired impact. en, craft the content to steer the audience toward
that feeling.
Consider the process of songwriting: To create a dance hit, you’d want to
start with the desired outcome of making people dance. e goal is to get

people moving, and the music is made to match this intention. is approach
is much more eective than writing a song rst and then attempting to make
it danceable.
Similarly, if you were creating a horror movie, the primary objective would
be to instill fear. is choice then informs subsequent decisions, such as moody
lighting and casting actors skilled in portraying fear. By focusing on the
emotional outcome rst, the rest of the production decisions naturally fall into
place.
ese principles apply to the content you create. Start by asking yourself
how to infuse drama or heightened impact into your content. is not only
provides a clear road map but also ensures that you include the necessary
drivers to make your content go viral. Starting with the desired eect gives you
a clearer vision of what to do to make your content resonate eectively with
your audience.
MetLife: Storytelling That Resonates
When it comes to evoking strong emotional reactions, the MetLife video
My Dad Is a Liar is a testament to the power of storytelling that leads with
intended eect. Instead of relying on traditional advertising methods, MetLife
focused on the emotional impact they aimed to achieve.
e video immediately captures viewer attention with a touching portrayal
of the bond between a father and his daughter. en, the narrative takes an
unexpected turn when the daughter dubs her father a liar, generating intrigue
and piquing viewer curiosity. e audience becomes invested in the emotional
story, wanting to understand the reason behind the daughter’s claim. is
heartfelt narrative is the reason why a video that ultimately delivers
information about an insurance company could amass millions of views.

Even after repeated viewings, the narrative continues to evoke emotional
responses. e brilliance behind this piece is rooted in the marketing team’s
approach: they focused on the eect they wanted to have on their audience
rather than on a logical message about their products or services.
is strategic shift in focus from selling a product to connecting
emotionally with an audience resulted in a narrative that doesn’t just promote
insurance but shares universal truths about love, sacrice, and familial bonds.
By starting with the eect, MetLife not only captured audience attention but
also created genuine aection for its brand.

ABC: Always Be Clever: Harnessing the Power of Cleverness in
Social Media Videos
Cleverness, dened by the equation “Unexpected + Smart = Cleverness,” is
one of the best-kept secrets to achieving virality in social media. It represents
the capacity to discover innovative solutions or insights in unexpected ways,
combined with the ability to perceive and connect seemingly unrelated
elements. is results in unique perspectives or solutions that others might
overlook. Cleverness thrives on the element of surprise, presenting a fresh
angle or an innovative twist to familiar scenarios.

Many top-performing content pieces across various formats showcase this
trait. By integrating clever elements throughout each aspect of your content—
from visuals and perspectives to processes and concepts—you can elevate your
videos to make them stand out in the crowded digital landscape. While the
ideal goal is to combine both a clever concept and clever production,
mastering even one can set you apart.
An excellent example of the impact of being clever can be seen in Prince
Ea’s Dear Future Generations: Sorry (2023). Although the theme of saving the
planet might appear routine and potentially boring, Prince Ea’s approach
illustrates that with cleverness, even commonplace topics can captivate viewers.
rough innovative delivery and visual interpretation, as well as smooth
editing, he transforms an ordinary idea into an extraordinary call to action.
In his video, Prince Ea presents himself as a representative apologizing to
future generations for the state of the planet that the current generation has
left behind. By using poetry and rhyme, he mourns the lost beauty of the
Amazon rainforest and emphasizes the crucial value of trees in sustaining life
on Earth. By cleverly wrapping his message in this unexpected format, he
breathes new life into a familiar topic, challenging viewers to rethink their
viewpoints.
True cleverness extends beyond mere intelligence or information sharing;
it thrives on the element of surprise by being unexpectedly intelligent, witty,
and insightful. is is precisely what Prince Ea achieves, attracting more than
30 million views for his video. By delivering an unanticipated interpretation
on a seemingly simple concept, he leaves a lasting impression that sparks
conversation.
Implementing cleverness in social media videos is a compelling strategy to
captivate and connect with viewers. Whether through clever ideas, unexpected
interpretations, or innovative visuals, the surprise factor leaves a memorable

impact. As you craft content, let the phrase “Always be clever” be your guide to
lasting viewership.
The Golden Triangle Technique: A Powerful Approach to
Eective Communication
e Golden Triangle Technique is a potent tool for conveying a message
succinctly and compellingly, using three essential elements:
1. Personal touch: Share a personal story or anecdote. is helps
establish an emotional connection with the audience by tapping
into relatability and authenticity.
2. Evidence and facts: Strengthen your narrative with hard facts—
be it data, research, or concrete examples. is provides credibility
to your message and supports its validity.
3. Timeless wisdom: Weave in philosophical insights or carefully
researched information. is adds depth, grounding your message
in universal truths and connecting it with time-honored
principles.
When these three elements come together, they present a persuasive
narrative that’s not only emotionally resonant but is also backed by evidence
and deep insight. is approach allows you to communicate eectively and
leave a lasting impact on your audience.
My team discovered the Golden Triangle Technique by analyzing content
created by Jay Shetty—a renowned author, coach, former monk, and
inuential content creator. He skillfully applies this method in many of his
content pieces. A standout example is his video You Can’t Love Someone You
Don’t Know. Here, Shetty shares a beautiful Indian tale about a musk deer
searching for a fragrance, only to realize that it emanates from a gland within

its own body. e story serves as a metaphor highlighting the fact that
oftentimes we search for external validation and love when real joy emerges
from within, through self-awareness and self-love. roughout the video,
Shetty seamlessly integrates relevant data, personal experiences, and
philosophical insights to deliver his profound message.
When crafting content, some pieces may benet from the Golden Triangle
Technique: interweaving personal stories with data and facts to lend
undeniable credibility, then anchoring them in time-tested wisdom for a
universal touch. Such a holistic approach deepens the resonance of your
content, making it both impactful and memorable.
The Jenga Theory: Crafting Engaging Narratives through
Tension and Anticipation
Inspired by the game of Jenga, where players meticulously pull blocks,
balancing tension with anticipation, the Jenga eory of storytelling relies on
similar principles, eectively engaging audiences. Although the collapse of a
Jenga tower is predictable, it’s the buildup—the small stories each block tells—
that captivates players. Similarly, Jenga eory storytelling excels in crafting
narratives with interconnected elements, keeping the audience on the edge of
their seats, eager for the next development.
STRUCTURE AND MECHANICS OF
JENGA THEORY IN STORYTELLING
1. Set the stage with a primary concept: Start by introducing the
central idea, giving a teaser about the broader narrative.
2. Introduce smaller questions and challenges: ese act as the
individual blocks in the Jenga tower. Instead of a linear path,
introduce smaller, interconnected segments or questions that
need answering.

3. Layered revelation: As one layer of tension (or one question) is
resolved, introduce a new one, maintaining the tension and
anticipation.
MARK ROBER AND THE ART OF
JENGA THEORY STORYTELLING
As mentioned earlier, Mark Rober, a renowned content creator boasting
more than 50 million YouTube subscribers and often garnering over 30
million views per video, is an expert at using the Jenga eory. While he
predominantly focuses on engineering—a subject not traditionally associated
with mass appeal—Rober’s skillful storytelling captivates and retains his
audience’s attention. His videos frequently kick o with a primary objective—
be it resolving a problem, answering a pivotal question, or breaking a record.
However, instead of a linear narrative, Rober intersperses his journey with
mini subsidiary questions, challenges, and obstacles, all of which he must
overcome to get to the nal resolution. Each of these elements heightens the
suspense, keeping the story fresh. By the end, much like a teetering Jenga
tower on its last leg, the climax delivers an amplied viewer anticipation and
pay o.
In his video Testing If Sharks Can Smell a Drop of Blood, which has garnered
more than 108 million views, Rober masterfully employs the Jenga eory.
Rather than diving directly into the main experiment, he begins by posing a
smaller question: “Do sharks prefer blood over other scents?” Before revealing
the results of the experiment, he explains the methodology. It becomes evident
that sharks prefer the scent of blood. en he delves into another question:
“How much blood attracts a shark?” Again, before commencing the
experiment, he explains the procedure. Surprisingly, during this experiment,
the viewer learns that sharks show no interest in human blood. Last, Rober

introduces a nal experiment: Could he re-create the iconic eect from e
Matrix where time appears to stand still and the camera moves around a
subject in slow motion, known as the “Matrix bullet time eect,” while diving
with sharks? is layered approach ensures sustained audience engagement
throughout the entirety of the video.
VERITASIUM’S MASTERY OF JENGA THEORY
Veritasium, a YouTube channel with more than 14.3 million subscribers
that creates content primarily about science and education, also uses the Jenga
eory in many of its videos. For example, in the video Why Are 96,000,000
Black Balls on is Reservoir?, which has amassed more than 96 million views,
the narrative doesn’t simply explain the phenomenon. Within the rst 20
seconds, Veritasium states that these shade balls are commonly believed to
reduce evaporation. However, they quickly debunk this misconception and
pose the question: “What are they really for?” is inquiry sets up the
framework for the Jenga-style narrative. e astonishing sight of 96 million
balls on water is emphasized, leading to more questions around the one-
minute mark: “Why are the balls black?,” “Are they safe for drinking water?,”
“How much do they cost?,” “Do they reduce evaporation?,” and “What is their
real purpose?” e video then shifts to answering these questions one by one,
with each answered question paving the way for another, culminating in
heightened anticipation and curiosity about the true purpose of the balls,
which is revealed at the very end.
***
e Jenga eory, with its intertwining layers of tension and anticipation,
crafts appealing narratives. By harnessing this method, creators can produce
content that resonates and keeps millions of viewers hooked.
Visualizing Complex Topics in a Simple and Unexpected Way

Transforming complex subjects into clear, engaging visuals is a powerful
driver for audience engagement. is performance driver allows content
creators to catch viewers o guard, turning seemingly dry or mundane topics
into memorable and engaging content.
An excellent example of this approach is demonstrated in Vox’s video How
Tax Brackets Actually Work. To many, tax brackets might come across as a
snooze-fest. Yet, Vox’s clever use of physical objects, such as paper cutouts,
illustrates the idea in a way that adds a whole new layer of intrigue and makes
it more accessible. Instead of leading with the plain facts, the approach of
starting with an engaging eect and then unraveling the logic behind it proves
eective, as it drew in nearly two million views. Although most of us would
rather avoid topics such as death and taxes, Vox’s innovative visual storytelling
brings the topic to life. A clever interpretation, backed with the right props,
can simplify concepts, making them more memorable.
In a similar vein, creator Jack Corbett, who joined NPR as the Tiny Desk
Intern and is a videographer and producer for Planet Money, known as
planetmoney on TikTok, tackles this topic in the video It’s Not One Big
Percent, It’s a Bunch of Little Brackets with eir Own Percents. Instead of using
paper cutouts, Corbett puts animated visuals directly on his body. is playful,
unique approach turns a potentially stale subject into something amusing and
fun.
When ideating content, content creators can consider this approach and
work backward to craft engaging stories about almost any subject. By
embracing creative and unexpected visual techniques, you can breathe life into
dry topics, leaving a lasting impact on viewers.
Analogies: Bridging the Known to the New

Analogies act as bridges, connecting what your audience already
understands to the new ideas you wish to introduce. ese bridges are
powerful drivers both in ideation and execution, which create a profound
impact on viewers. In Wired’s video with over 5.2 million views, Neuroscientist
Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Diculty, the use of analogies is brilliantly
demonstrated. Here, a neuroscientist explains the complex concept of the
connectome—the intricate network of neural pathways in our brains and
nervous systems—to individuals of varying ages and expertise.
e video opens with the neuroscientist talking to a ve-year-old about the
connectome. e child’s shocked and amazed reaction to learning that our
brains have more cells than the visible stars in the sky mirrors the eect that
well-crafted analogies have on viewers. Such comparisons can blow our minds
and change our perspectives.
Ernest Lupinacci, a seasoned creative director, also introduced my team to
the potent “You know how . . . ?” phrase, a tool to uncover impactful analogies
and memorable Hook Points for brands, products, or services. When
relaunching the Dasani brand, Lupinacci shifted the focus from the health
aspects of bottled water to taste—a more universal preference. Using the “You
know how . . . ?” framework, he devised an engaging narrative:
You know how there are 75,000 water brands in the market, and we’re supposed to
drink eight glasses of water a day? “Yeah, I do know that. I hear it all the time. People repeat
that to me. ere’s one of those giant water coolers in my oce. Water, water, water, water.”
Well, you know how you can’t gure out if one is better than the other? “Yeah.” Well, you
know how at the end of the day, whatever you drink or eat still needs to appeal to you? It’s
got to taste good; otherwise, it’s medicine, right? “Yeah, I do know that.” Well, you should
try some Dasani. Dasani is the water that makes your mouth water.
By using the “You know how . . . ?” methodology, you can gauge the
eectiveness of your ideas and their resonance with your audience. is
structure helps you identify analogies that genuinely strike a chord, making
your content and stories more compelling and engaging.

One More Layer
In content creation, depth is often the dierence between a eeting
engagement and a memorable experience. Single-dimensional storytelling can
fall at unless it’s extremely appealing, which is why introducing multiple
layers to your narrative is helpful.
An excellent example is Wired’s video Neuroscientist Explains One Concept
in 5 Levels of Diculty, which I mentioned in the previous section. Again, at
its core, the video presents the idea of the connectome—an intriguing concept
but not necessarily one with mass appeal. Yet, the additional layer of
presenting the concept in ve levels of diculty (to a ve-year-old, a teenager,
a high school student, a graduate student, and an industry professional) adds
depth and intrigue, resulting in more than 5.2 million views.
One of the driving factors behind the success of these multilayered videos is
adaptability. Explaining a complex concept to varied audiences requires
adjusting the delivery for a child, a teenager, and an expert. ese dierent
layers of interactions and reactions make the concept even more fascinating
and relatable to a wider audience.
Another creative iteration of this approach is seen in Brian Mendoza’s
video Horrible Singer Uses Magic Water & is Happened. is video provides
an intriguing example of adding layers to music content. Layer one revolves
around his musical performance, which is engaging but not extraordinary.
Layer two comes into play when he decides to play his music to strangers on
the internet. At rst, Mendoza meets their expectations, as he deliberately sings
poorly while the strangers try to be polite. en, layer three is introduced
when he takes a sip of “magic water,” resulting in a sudden improvement in his
singing. is captivating gimmick not only hooks viewers but also leaves them
pleasantly astonished.

e combination of these layers—music performance, virtual interactions,
and the gimmick—elevates the video into an immersive experience. As viewers
witness the strangers’ genuine amazement on-screen, they can’t help but be
drawn into the shared experience. e story of his transformation from a bad
singer to a skilled one becomes a powerful hook that carries them through the
entire journey and helped Mendoza garner more than 3.7 million views.
Without these layers in his storytelling, his music and videos wouldn’t attract
this much attention.
You can apply the concept of adding multiple layers to any content vertical.
Recognizing the impact of these layers and their ability to captivate an
audience can be a game-changer in creating content that doesn’t just get
watched but is also remembered and shared.
Harnessing Absurdity
Absurdity can be a magnet for attention in a content-saturated world.
Consider e Food eorists’ video Food eory: e Candy Commercials at
HAUNT Your Brain! Here, they unpack the history of a peculiar starburst
commercial, “Berries and Cream.” Although the ad rst went viral in 2007, it’s
unexpected resurgence in 2022 on TikTok demonstrates the staying power of
absurd content.
e key takeaway from the video is that breaking the mold, straying from
convention, and embracing the unexpected not only grabs attention but
retains it. e secret lies in adding a twist to familiar events so they become a
little unexpected and absurd. is approach resonates with viewers, leaving a
lasting impression and making memories that stick with them for a lifetime.
Per Sederberg, a psychology professor at e Ohio State University,
explains that memorable experiences often arise from intertwining the familiar
with the unexpected. While we build memories on the foundation of known

experiences, it’s the unexpected twist that surprises us and rmly imprints the
event in our memory.
e power of absurdity lies in its ability to be just strange enough to make
people stay and keep watching. It doesn’t need to veer into the realm of the
utterly bizarre; even a subtle twist is often enough to leave a lasting impact on
an audience. By infusing content with elements of absurdity, you can create a
distinct, engrossing viewer experience. is not only keeps viewers hooked but
also encourages them to share the content, increasing its reach and inuence.
The Audience Is Yours to Lose
Once someone starts watching your video, the challenge is to maintain
their attention. Viewers typically drop o as videos progress, making it
essential to hook them from the outset and keep them engaged throughout.
Every moment in your video needs deliberate thought and attention. From
the opening scene to the closing shot, ensure that you’re crafting content based
on thorough research and that incorporates relevant data. Even a slight
oversight can dramatically impact your video’s success.
It’s important to remember that viewers have countless other options
readily available. If the intro of your video doesn’t captivate them, many might
click away before reaching the content’s peak moments. is drives home the
importance of structured, immediate engagement. Seize your audience’s
attention from the beginning, and sustain their interest through to the end. By
blending strategic planning with compelling storytelling and data-driven
insights, you heighten the chances of retaining your viewers and maximizing
your content’s reach.
EXERCISE: EVALUATING YOUR VIDEO SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUR
REFERENCE: BRINGING YOUR BEST IDEA TO LIFE

After identifying your standout idea—one that’s rooted in research, is
powered by compelling performance drivers, features an eective hook,
applies engaging storytelling techniques, and is supported by an outstanding
reference—it’s time to bring it to life in video form. Refer to your Ideation
Sheet and craft your video, keeping in mind all the insights you’ve gathered
thus far.
Before posting your video, it’s benecial to compare it side by side with
your Gold reference video. Applying the insights from this book during this
pre-posting analysis will help you discern how well you’ve integrated the
nuances and key performance drivers, and also pinpoint what could be
improved. is step is crucial for rening your skills and progressively
enhancing your content. Also, if a video doesn’t perform as expected after
posting, this comparative exercise can provide valuable insights into why it
may have fallen short, guiding your strategy for future content. Remember,
each video you create and analyze is a learning opportunity, taking you one
step closer to mastering the art of resonating with the masses.
Follow this step-by step guide to conducting a detailed analysis of your
video alongside its benchmark Gold reference:
STEP 1: SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEWING
Open two separate windows on your computer, and place them side by
side for easy comparison. As you watch, break down each element and
performance driver’s contribution to the reference video’s success (as noted in
your Ideation Sheet), and assess whether your video achieves the same impact.
Focus specically on qualitative elements such as transitions, visuals, audio,
pacing, and the overall storytelling structure. Try not to get drawn into the
content itself, but rather, the way it’s presented. Reect on the emotions

elicited by each video, and consider how the benchmark Gold video maintains
viewer engagement.
STEP 2: IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT
During the analysis, identify areas in your video that may require
improvement. Does the Gold reference video have certain elements that
outshine yours? Consider how you can enhance your content to match or
outperform the benchmark video.
STEP 3: REFINE YOUR VIDEO
If you notice that parts of your video fall at, make the necessary edits to
rene the storytelling, and include the performance drivers from the Gold
reference. Make adjustments in order to mirror what makes the Gold
reference video stand out. Keep rening until you’re sure your video nails the
correct elements.
STEP 4: FINAL REVIEW
After adjustments, conduct a nal review. Keep polishing your video until
it impeccably integrates the sought-after performance drivers and subtleties.
Remember, video content creation is a journey of continual learning. By
regularly analyzing and adjusting based on top-performing benchmarks,
you’re setting yourself up for success. Happy creating!
RATIOS VS. ABSOLUTES
When you begin posting content and seek to analyze its metrics,
understanding the dierence between ratios and absolutes is crucial.
Metrics like reach or impressions might appear impressive, but they don’t

delve deep enough to reveal genuine viewer engagement. Reach merely
signies that content appeared on someone’s timeline, without conrming
whether they actually viewed the video.
Rather than focusing solely on broad metrics such as reach or
impressions, delving into ratios can oer more meaningful insights into
viewer engagement. It’s essential, however, to note that the availability and
specicity of these metrics can dier across various social media platforms.
e following examples act as guidelines, drawing from metrics frequently
available across platforms.

A key metric, available on many platforms, is the view rate. is
measures the proportion of individuals who viewed at least three seconds of
the video, in relation to its reach. For instance, if you have a 40 percent
view rate, it means that 40 out of 100 people viewed at least three seconds
of your video. is ratio sheds light on how eectively the video’s initial
moments hold viewers’ attention. Platforms such as Facebook and
Instagram oer insights about viewers who’ve watched at least three
seconds of videos. A low view rate on these platforms suggests enhancing
the beginning of the video to better captivate the audience.
Platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok oer
another metric: the retention graph. is metric depicts the percentage of
viewers who continue watching the video as it progresses. Typically, this
graph starts at 100 percent and gradually tapers o as viewers stop
watching. Analyzing the retention graph allows you to identify specic
segments in the video where viewers lose interest or engagement drops.
Recognizing these dips in retention is crucial, as it guides content creators
to rene their strategies and video content accordingly.
It’s important to familiarize yourself with the analytics tools or
dashboards specic to your chosen platform. Each platform brings its
unique metrics and insights to the table, tailored to its user behavior and
content type. Recognizing and adapting to these subtleties can signicantly
enhance your content strategy.
Overall, the primary advantage of focusing on ratios and actionable
data lies in their power to drive purposeful action. Instead of being satised
with high reach or impressions, you can proactively analyze the view rate
and retention graph to optimize your content and elevate viewer
engagement. By leveraging this actionable data, you can make informed

decisions and continually improve the eectiveness of your social media
content.

PART II
VIRAL FORMATS

FORMAT STRATEGIES—SECTION 1
THE BEAUTY OF A VIRAL
FRAMEWORK
Having mastered research, analysis, ideation, and the art of storytelling, you’re
now better equipped to understand more of the intricacies of Viral Formats.
Remember, a Viral Format is a storytelling structure that can adapt to any type
of subject matter and remains relevant for extended periods of time—even
years. is is dierent from a trend, which is eeting. A format dictates the
way in which a story unfolds, and how information is presented in a social
media video. Mastering a single successful format can dramatically increase
your odds of consistently going viral.
Top creators across the globe frequently choose a specic format and
consistently use it to craft their stories. By mastering a chosen format, they see
improved performance metrics and achieve greater success by understanding
its nuances.
As you might now realize, becoming a consistent and lasting viral sensation
rarely occurs from producing a massive amount of content, adopting trendy
hashtags, or chasing eeting trends. Instead, it’s about investing your time,
energy, and resources to excel in a single top-performing format.
ere are countless formats to choose from for your content. In fact, to
date, Hook Point has conducted in-depth research on more than 200 dierent
formats. However, identifying one that consistently yields the best outcomes is
just the beginning. It’s crucial to thoroughly analyze and understand every
aspect of this successful format. As outlined in the research section of this

book, such detailed examination is key to replicating and enhancing successful
outcomes. By fully understanding the components and nuances of the format
you select, you can strategically execute it and fully capitalize on its potential
in your social media strategy.
Renowned content creators have proven that success comes from
concentrating on, and excelling in, a single top-performing format. e
success stories of Dr. Julie Smith, Hunter Prosper, Dylan Page, Alex Stemp,
Vox, Dylan Page, and Danielle Labelle attest to the power of focusing on one
content format. ese content creators and media companies have consistently
used a specic storytelling structure that resonates with their viewers, driving
signicant growth and engagement.
Alex Stemp’s consistent use of the “Man on the Street” format has allowed
him to reach a massive following of 20 million. His approach, which involves
oering professional photo shoots to random strangers within this format has
proven to be compelling.
Media powerhouses such as Vox and Veritasium have also recognized the
value of mastering a single format. eir commitment to rening their chosen
storytelling structures has established their status as reliable sources of engaging
and informative content, securing them a loyal audience and widespread
recognition.
Formats: The Three-Act Structure of the Digital Age
As mentioned earlier, Viral Formats are video storytelling structures that
serve as frameworks into which creators can strategically insert their own
brands, identities, stories, or ideas. ese structured templates provide a
consistent narrative framework, guiding the presentation of content in a way
that connects with the masses. Top formats oer a versatile canvas for creators
to insert their messages and creativity.

Although some might express concerns about potential creative constraints,
it’s essential to recognize that just as most movies follow the three-act structure,
social media content similarly thrives when aligned with platform-specic
formats. e three-act framework is a storytelling technique that segments a
narrative into three distinct phases, often termed the Introduction, the
Challenge, and the Climax. is method gained traction through Syd Field’s
1979 book, Screenplay: e Foundations of Screenwriting.
e Introduction (Act I):
Presents the central characters, their environment, and the
initial dilemma.
Sets the scene and identies what’s at risk.
Concludes with a pivotal event that drives the protagonist into
the story’s core conict.
e Challenge (Act II):
Is central to the narrative and delves deeper into the story’s
complications and character developments.
e point where the protagonist faces multiple obstacles, often
leading to a critical turning point.
e Climax (Act III):
Resolves the central conict, drawing the narrative to its
conclusion.
Provides a resolution for the protagonist and other key
characters.

Take a legendary lmmaker such as Steven Spielberg as an example: His
unparalleled success stems from his commitment to understanding and using
the time-tested three-act structure in cinema. He has won three Academy
Awards and nine Golden Globes by adhering to this tried-and-true storytelling
method. Spielberg has never compromised his creativity, but rather, has
mastered the art of translating his vision within this structure. If he tried to
reinvent the three-act structure (aka the format) each time he created a lm, he
wouldn’t be a world-class storyteller. It’s too complicated and wastes valuable
time. Instead, he strengthens his use of this structure to tell the stories he’s
passionate about.
e beauty of the three-act structure is its adaptability. Despite being a
staple across diverse genres—be it drama, comedy, horror, action, or sci-—it
never diminishes the distinctive charm of each lm. Similarly, even when
multiple creators use the same format, each video emerges with its own distinct
avor. It’s in this spirit that I urge you to identify a format using the research
model detailed in this book—one that truly resonates with you—and commit
wholeheartedly to mastering it.
My team has identied and analyzed hundreds of top-performing formats
using the model outlined within these pages, gleaning insights into the nuances
behind structures that consistently yield impressive outcomes. e analysis of
formats in this section serves as a testament to how the Viral Content Model
operates, as well as my team’s dedicated research and analysis.
While we journey through a few standout Viral Formats, it’s essential to
understand that these are merely examples of how we break down and
understand their mechanics. If the formats showcased here don’t align with
your brand or business goals, don’t be discouraged. You can always utilize our
research model to identify other formats that suit your needs. Remember,

these are not the only formats you can use to achieve success, but they provide
insight into the kind of analysis that can lead to such success.
Note: Content formats span both short- and long-form narratives. Short-
form formats, typically ranging from 10 seconds to three minutes, are popular
on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, YouTube shorts, and Instagram Reels.
Meanwhile, long-form formats, usually eight or more minutes, and
occasionally extending into hours, are featured on YouTube, enabling creators
to dig deep into a subject—even mini documentaries. In this chapter, our
primary focus will be on short-form formats, with one long-form example. If
you’re interested in delving deeper into long-form formats, the model in this
book oers guidance for conducting your own research. (Additionally, my
team and I collaborate with clients to carry out research and craft strategies

FORMAT STRATEGIES—SECTION 2
THE VISUAL METAPHOR VIRAL
FORMAT (SHORT FORM)
Have you ever felt that your product or service is too mature for TikTok?
Have you assumed that the platform was just for lighthearted dance routines
and the like? Well, you’re in good company. Many content creators—
especially those who are serious professionals, such as physicians, therapists, and
nancial advisers—hesitate to engage on TikTok, worrying that their
profound insights may fall on deaf ears. Yet, innovative creators are shattering
the misconception that TikTok is “too young” for their messages, eectively
harnessing the platform’s power by learning to speak its language.
Introducing the Visual Metaphor Viral Format
anks to the Viral Content Model’s meticulous research and analysis,
we’ve successfully analyzed this Viral Format. It stands as a powerful tool that
makes abstract or complex topics digestible and, believe it or not, primed for
virality. Let’s dive into its mechanics:
1. An abstract or complex topic: e core subject or idea.
2. A visual representation: Using physical objects to represent the
topic visually.
3. A verbal explanation: Articulating the topic for clarity.
Notable content creators, such as psychologist Julie Smith, who has over
4.7 million followers on TikTok and more than 1.9 million on Instagram,

break down complex subjects like PTSD, panic attacks, and stress. Take, for
instance, her video titled Want to Be Happy? Don’t Make is Mistake, which
can be viewed at http://guide.hookpoint.com/, along with all the other videos
in this book and chapter. is video, which has amassed more than 20 million
views, features Smith using a rubber sh and a sh tank to illustrate the
toxicity in our environments and how it impacts our well-being, drawing
parallels to real-life scenarios.
e video script is as follows:
Don’t make this mistake when you are working on your own happiness. Imagine this is you [she
holds up a rubber sh] and this is your life [points to a sh tank]. But like most people’s lives,
there are problems that can make it toxic [she drops some brown colored dye into the water]. If
a sh is living in a toxic environment, eventually it gets sick. So you take her out of the dirty water
and put her in a new tank for a while [puts sh in a clean tank of water], kind of like how you
take a break—you go on holiday for a few weeks into a new environment and it helps, everything
gets better and feels great for a while until you return and go right back to that toxic situation again
[puts the sh back in the dirty tank]. It doesn’t matter how clean the water was on your break or
how refreshed you feel, eventually you will get sick again. If you want to thrive in the long term
[drops sh back in the clean tank of water], you have to focus on cleaning up the environment
that is aecting you every day. I’m a psychologist. Follow for more.
Although this video stands out as one of Smith’s top-performing pieces, not
every one of her visual metaphors reaches the same level of success. So, what
dierentiates the Gold (high performing) from the Silver (baseline) and the
Bronze (underperforming)?
Based on my team’s analysis, the primary drivers inuencing the virality of
content within this format are:
1. Active metaphor: Use an object as an active participant in the
narrative, which visually demonstrates concepts and eectively
complements verbal storytelling.
2. Tension: Build anticipation or suspense to engage viewers.

3. Potential energy: Engage the viewer’s attention from the start
by suggesting that the story or object possesses potential and
kinetic energy that is on the verge of being released.
4. Perspective shift: Present a familiar idea or circumstance; then
reframe it in a way that viewers have likely never experienced
before.
5. Cleverness: Depict the topic visually in an unexpected and
smart way.
6. Immediately applicable: Oer advice that not only presents a
new way of thinking but that can also be applied instantly by
the viewer.
Now, let’s delve deeper into each of these performance drivers.
ACTIVE METAPHOR
e high-performing Gold videos feature dynamic visual metaphors, where
objects are active participants in the story and explanation. ese visual
elements embody the concept being explained, reducing the viewer’s
dependence on the verbal explanation. is combination of visual and
auditory storytelling enhances understanding and captures the viewer’s
attention eectively.
Top of FormConsider Smith’s Crumpled Paper Trauma, which has gotten
more than 12 million views on TikTok. She goes beyond verbal explanation
and physically manipulates props to demonstrate the experience of trauma and
its therapeutic management. e video begins with a basket lled with
crumpled paper—a visual metaphor for the overwhelming sense of stress or
trauma. By the end, the paper is neatly folded at the bottom, creating space in
the basket, which visually represents relief and therapeutic process.

As emphasized in Part I of this book, the performance drivers for Gold
video formats are more apparent when cross-analyzed with the lower-
performing Bronze category videos. Smith’s Cars in Trac, which garnered a
modest 128,900 views on TikTok, fails to maximize the potential of the
objects. e props are static, and viewers are asked to imagine the concept
rather than see it demonstrated. e lack of movement and interaction
prevents the props from eectively symbolizing the narrative, making the
video less engaging and more dicult to follow.
TENSION
Building tension is a crucial component of visual metaphors. It creates a
sense of a looming problem that needs resolution, compelling viewers to keep
watching. is engagement is benecial, as it signals to platform algorithms
that the content retains viewer interest.
For example, in the high-performing Gold video Burnout, which has
amassed more than 3.6 million views, Smith introduces tension by lighting a
match at the beginning and holding it as the video progresses. e ame
inches closer to her ngers as she speaks, which makes it obvious that if she
doesn’t put out the re, she’s going to burn her ngers. is growing tension
not only symbolizes the mental strain that occurs as one nears burnout, but
also strengthens the verbal message with a compelling visual narrative.
In contrast, the low-performing Bronze video Condence Check-In, which
only garnered 61,400 views, fails to incorporate tension in its visual metaphor.
Although Smith points to dierent colors in a rainbow to represent dierent
levels of condence, there’s no visual indication of a problem that needs
addressing. Without this element of tension, the visual metaphor lacks urgency
and fails to engage viewers as eectively.

POTENTIAL ENERGY
Openers in videos are crucial. In the Visual Metaphor Viral Format, the
high-performing Gold videos subtly hint to the viewer that the story or object
possesses potential and kinetic energy, signaling that this energy is about to be
unleashed.
In Smith’s video Kintsugi, which has gained 854,600 views on TikTok, the
very rst frame shows Smith holding a plate in one hand and a hatchet in the
other, immediately setting the stage for potential action. is visual creates a
strong sense of potential energy. However, the video could have been more
eective if she had delayed smashing the plate to build up tension for a longer
period of time.
On the other hand, Smith’s Improvements and Setbacks, with 108,600 views
on TikTok, demonstrates lower potential energy in its introduction. Initially,
it’s unclear what Smith is holding. Only when she removes the cap does it
become apparent that it’s a marker. Since viewers cannot immediately identify
the object, they are less likely to form subconscious expectations about any
visible release of energy.
CLEVERNESS
Top-performing Gold videos in this format often distinguish themselves
through their cleverness, which my team and I dene as being unexpectedly
smart. Although many videos showcase smart ideas or unexpected elements,
the top ones combine these aspects to create something that ts this
description. e goal is to present content that makes viewers think, Why
didn’t I think of it like that?
In Smith’s Grief Circle Painting, which has more than 4.5 million views on
TikTok, the cleverness is evident. e video uses a black spot to symbolize
grief. For most of it, the secondary camera focuses on this black spot as
colorful circles are painted around it, making the spot appear large and

dominant. However, in the end, it’s revealed that the black spot is quite small
in the context of the surrounding colors. is symbolic representation of grief
is clever because it draws an unexpected parallel between seemingly unrelated
elements.
Conversely, Smith’s Anxiety Rainbow, with 73,700 views on TikTok,
displays less cleverness in its visual metaphor. e video uses layers of a
rainbow to represent dierent levels of coping with anxiety. As each layer is
removed, symbolizing how anxiety erodes various aspects of a person’s life, the
metaphor becomes predictable. When the nal layer is removed, it’s fairly
obvious that the layers will be reapplied. Although the metaphor is smart, its
predictability detracts from its cleverness.
IMMEDIATELY APPLICABLE
A key element for creating high-performing Gold videos is to provide
advice that can be immediately put into practice. Suggestions that introduce
fresh perspectives and are universally applicable tend to engage audiences more
eectively and yield better performance. Conversely, content that presents
recommendations not readily actionable tends to fall short in viewer
retention.
For example, Smith’s Toxic Environment , with more than 12 million views
on TikTok, oers universally applicable advice. It guides viewers on assessing
how their everyday environments impact their mental health. is advice is
actionable right away, as viewers can always reect on their surroundings.
In contrast, goodwisequotes’ Four Top Psychology Tips, which has garnered
13,800 views on TikTok, oers multiple pieces of advice but is lacking in
terms of immediate applicability. An example from this video suggests that if
viewers suspect someone is staring at them, they should look at the ceiling; if
the other person looks up as well, it likely means they were indeed staring. is
scenario is not commonly encountered by most people, meaning that viewers

might have to wait an indenite amount of time before they can apply this
suggestion. Such a delay in applicability can make the advice less impactful and
relevant.

FORMAT STRATEGIES—SECTION 3
THE “TWO CHARACTERS, ONE
LIGHTBULB” VIRAL FORMAT
(SHORT FORM)
Urban legends and modern myths captivate us all; yet, at times, an
enlightening “lightbulb” moment reframes our misconceptions. is format
gives creators an innovative way to address and debunk such misconceptions.
A standout example of this format is Are You Eating Puppy Portions? by Creator
@EmilyHackettFitness. is video, along with all other videos in this chapter,
can be found at http://guide.hookpoint.com/) and has garnered more than
seven million views.
In these videos, the creator often plays two roles: expert and novice. e
novice, unaware of their misconception, is enlightened by the expert during a
short exchange. is revelation, or lightbulb moment, leads to actionable
advice from the expert.
Top creators who use this format excel in highlighting the dierences
between novice and expert roles, building compelling tension. ey use this
tension to position their channel or expertise as the solution to common
misconceptions. is versatile format spans various domains such as tness,
law, real estate, and nance, where creators debunk myths and showcase how
they can guide their audience toward clarity and understanding. By skillfully
using this format, creators produce content that entertains, educates,
challenges norms, and promotes personal growth.

Top-performing Gold videos in this format are fun and informative. By
using contrasting elements, they shift perspectives and drive home their
messages. eir wide appeal stems from debunking common misconceptions
and oering solutions that resonate with a diverse audience.
e hypotheses that my team and I have developed regarding the
performance drivers that contribute to virality in this format include:
1. Contrast
2. Breaking misconceptions
3. Digestible, actionable Information
4. Eective pacing
5. Leave viewers wanting more
6. Let’s explore each of these in depth.
CONTRAST
Contrast plays a pivotal role in Gold-performing videos in the Two
Characters, One Lightbulb format. It highlights the stark dierences between
the two characters. Creators cleverly incorporate contrast through various
means such as delivery, visual elements, or the script, establishing tension
between the characters. is tension crafts a compelling narrative that
juxtaposes two viewpoints on a single subject. e exaggerated dierences
often elicit humor, which engages and entertains the audience. rough this
dynamic, creators position themselves, or their services, as the catalyst for the
novice’s perspective shift.
A Gold-standard example of contrast can be seen in calltoleap’s video
Making $80k at Home, which amassed 3.6 million views. In the video, the
novice character’s arrogant demeanor starkly contrasts with the expert’s
composed manner. Intriguingly, both characters earn $80,000 a year; yet the

novice is tied to a conventional nine-to-ve grind, which is much less
appealing than the expert’s enviable 15-minute workweek.
On the other hand, a Bronze-standard example of contrast is showcased in
Insurance for Your Stocks, which only captured 130,000 views. Although there’s
a subtle dierence in the personalities of the characters, the primary topic lacks
the sharp contrast observed in the Gold-standard video. Instead of building
tension between the characters, it merely presents information. ere’s no
signicant aha moment, and the novice character doesn’t appear to conict
with or oppose the expert in any manner.
e eective utilization of contrast enables creators to craft content with
humor, anticipation, and dynamic ow. It paves the way for building tension,
which provides an opportunity to introduce a creator’s service as the solution.
Contrast can be infused into every aspect of content creation—be it the
delivery, visuals, or story structure. By exaggerating contrasts, creators infuse
humor, captivating their audience.
So, to maximize the impact of contrast, try to incorporate prevalent
industry misconceptions into your content. is strategy produces relatable
videos that resonate with viewers.
BREAKING MISCONCEPTIONS
e Two Characters, One Lightbulb format gains viral traction when it
eectively claries or challenges common misconceptions, leading to a shift in
the audience’s perspective. Gold content in this format dees expectations by
presenting alternative and innovative ways to consider familiar topics.
A prime example of breaking misconceptions is showcased in the Making
$80k at Home video. As touched on above in the “Contrast“ section, it
challenges the notion of a standard workweek by showing how someone can

make $80,000 a year while working only 15 minutes a week, challenging
conventional beliefs.
Conversely, the Bronze example Car Insurance, with only 150,000 views,
fails to eectively address misconceptions. It lacks contrast and doesn’t oer
valuable insights to truly engage its audience.
Gold videos in this format give the viewer a perspective shift and
completely change what they think is possible. is equips the audience with
valuable insights and triggers enlightening aha moments.
DIGESTIBLE, ACTIONABLE INFORMATION
Gold videos in the Two Characters, One Lightbulb format deliver practical
advice on seemingly complex tasks, such as buying a home, making them
appear straightforward and attainable. Creators present this advice concisely,
ensuring that viewers aren’t overwhelmed with technicalities. As a result,
viewers leave with invaluable takeaways.
A Gold example of incorporating digestible, actionable information in the
Two Characters, One Lightbulb format is Mortgages Explained by
@ecommjess. is video, which garnered 1.9 million views, takes the
monumental task of buying a house and makes the process feel achievable by
explaining the loan options available to rst-time buyers.
Conversely, the Bronze example Roth IRA, has only 20,000 views, failing
to achieve a standout performance. It opens using inaccessible jargon, which
disconnects and overwhelms viewers. From the outset, they feel left behind,
pondering the denition of a Roth IRA. is lack of clarity about the topic
causes viewers to tune out immediately.
To make your content compelling and engaging, it’s essential that
information is both actionable and widely comprehensible. Top performers in
this format captivate viewers by addressing common and relatable topics—

from buying a house to tness routines. Attracting a wider audience—even
those not inherently interested in a subject—amplies engagement. Before
attempting to shift perspectives, ensure that viewers grasp the subject at hand.
Bombarding them with technical terms will only deter engagement, as viewers
pay attention to creators who take a complex topic and make it approachable.
EFFECTIVE PACING
Pacing in videos refers to the rhythm at which ideas and stories are
presented, focusing less on the quantity of shots and more on the speed at
which the narrative progresses. Eective pacing highlights key information
while swiftly moving through repetitive details, ensuring that the audience
remains engaged. In Gold videos, creators master the art of pacing, getting
straight to the point and propelling the story forward with precision. e
script and delivery provide just the right dose of background information to
spark viewers’ interest, maintaining a pace that keeps them engaged without
being overwhelmed. e seamless ow of content elements leaves no room for
boredom or loss of interest. In Bronze videos, there are often random jokes
thrown in that slow down the pacing of the video.
Earning the Gold for eective pacing, with 1.2 million views, is
EmilyHackettFitness’ Bored of Your Diet. is video is fun, engaging, and
eectively highlights the contrast between dierent diets without resorting to
over-the-top acting or silliness. It shows one character eating delicious protein
pancakes for breakfast, while the other character is having rice crackers,
broccoli, and chicken. e character eating the pancakes explains that she’s still
following a diet that helps her lose fat. is video’s fast pace keeps viewers
engaged, stays on the subject, and continually propels the story forward with
each line the characters say.

In contrast, the Bronze example TALKING TO HEALTH INSURANCE
PT. 1, by @ecommjess, with a modest 28,000 views, falls short in pacing due
to a drawn-out story that prompts viewers to click away before the message
lands. e entire narrative involving the pizza, counting money, and the
interaction with the woman’s boss takes up too much time before introducing
the truly important element: the pharmacy.
To create compelling content, it’s crucial to nd the right balance in the
pace. Getting to the heart of the matter quickly and maintaining an engaging
tempo will keep your audience interested and invested in the story. Avoiding
excessive theatrics and unnecessary prolongation helps enhance message
delivery, creating a lasting impression. It’s tempting to pack content with
multiple points and an abundance of jokes. However, the key to truly
resonating with your audience lies in crafting one major aha moment or a
signicant shift in perspective. is singular, powerful insight is what truly
captivates viewers. People aren’t looking for an exhaustive rundown of every
detail or step. ey crave that one transformative insight that fundamentally
alters their thinking.
Gold videos in this format drive the story forward with rhythmic pacing
that grabs viewers’ attention. ese videos always move forward, and the
tempo never slows or stalls. at way, when the creator begins providing
advice, the transition feels like an organic and obvious next step. Although
subjects such as “Roth IRA” or “mortgage” might not inherently spark
excitement, the right pacing can inject energy into these otherwise mundane
topics.
Although videos in this format are typically short, length is secondary to
viewer experience. Focus on maintaining engagement, rather than on meeting
some arbitrary time limit. Experiment with your content. If you hold your

audience’s attention, they’ll keep watching—whether it’s for 30 seconds or 30
minutes.
LEAVE VIEWERS WANTING MORE
e best content in this format paves a clear pathway for viewers to learn
more about a topic. Top creators give us just enough information to entice us
without overwhelming us, demystifying seemingly dicult subjects and
encouraging us to follow along. is gives the creator the opportunity to insert
a clear call to action (CTA), which is an instruction to the audience designed
to provoke an immediate response, typically using an imperative verb such as
“Follow,” “Find out more,” or “Visit a store today.” is CTA encourages the
audience to take the next logical step, whether it’s following the creator or
watching a second video.
When these CTAs emerge organically, after delivering valuable insights,
they don’t feel petty or insincere. e audience appreciates that the creator
didn’t leave them hanging, and they are gratied rather than teased. Viewers
feel smarter for having watched the video and are motivated to learn more.
Earning the Gold in CTA with 5.9 million views is Creatine Explained by
@noeldeyzel_bodybuilder on TikTok. In this video, he simplies the complex
debate of being natural versus using performance-enhancing drugs in
bodybuilding. He claries that taking creatine, a legal sports supplement, does
not make a bodybuilder “unnatural.” He explains that only those who use
anabolic hormones or performance-enhancing substances fall into the
unnatural category. After watching this video, viewers feel informed and
empowered, gaining condence in the benets of following his advice, and
they are compelled to check out the Ryse creatine being promoted.
On the ip side, the Bronze in CTA for the Two Characters, One
Lightbulb format goes to I Will Never Be Able to Buy a House by @ecommjess.

With only 11,000 views, the video presents a jargon-heavy introduction,
delving into topics related to real estate investment trusts. It necessitates an
understanding of terms such as dividends, trusts, and Roth IRAs. e content’s
complexity tends to deter viewer engagement and interest in learning more
about real estate investment trusts (REITs).
A well-executed CTA can motivate your audience to become more
involved with your brand, either by becoming a follower or even a client. A
misplaced or impromptu CTA can seem articial. So, try to build up a
question or interest in your audience (by presenting contrasting elements, for
example), and then present the CTA as a natural resolution to this question.
By serving value up front and directing viewers toward the next step, you can
foster a sense of trust and credibility, making them more likely to engage with
your brand and content in the future.

FORMAT STRATEGIES—SECTION 4
THE UNTOLD STORIES VIRAL
FORMAT (SHORT FORM)
Daniel Wall is a master of the Untold Stories Viral Format. With a behind-the-
scenes lens, he delves into the intricate, often unexplored narratives of the
entertainment industry. Just when viewers believe they’re following one story,
Wall takes them on a journey into uncharted territory, evoking an exhilarating
“Oh wait, what?!” response.
“Daniel’s Wall,” the name of his channel on YouTube and TikTok, cleverly
reects Wall’s ability to pull back the curtain to expose untold captivating
stories hidden behind the walls of the entertainment world. He immerses
viewers into these narratives, spotlighting the intriguing stories that go beyond
supercial tropes. e content focuses on the underappreciated “deep cuts” of
the industry, oering a fresh perspective on familiar subjects. Although Wall
uses this format primarily to break down stories in the entertainment industry,
it is versatile enough to be applied to a wide range of subjects and industries.
Wall’s consistency as a creator is evident; his videos consistently surpass a
million views. Yet, it’s in his standout videos—those garnering three million
views or more—where we see key nuances that contribute to his success.
e hypotheses my team and I developed regarding the performance
drivers for virality in this format include:
1. Strong hooks with the promise of a story.
2. Introducing the deep cut.

3. Highlighting narratives centered on overcoming obstacles with
high stakes.
4. Resolving tension by delivering impactful conclusions for
characters or intriguing insights for the audience.
Strong Hooks with the Promise of a Story
Strong hooks that promise an intriguing story have an eect on the viewer
that captures attention and builds expectations immediately. ey give viewers
an initial reason to invest their time in watching the entire video. e Untold
Stories format uses one-liner hooks that make viewers pause to give the video a
chance. ey particularly excel at oering the promise of hidden insights,
fostering a sense of discovery that piques viewer interest.
As Wall gradually provides context about the hook through additional
information, he starts to craft a narrative that heightens audience expectations.
is increased curiosity urges viewers to stick around and discover what
happens next so they can either conrm or challenge initial assumptions.
In his most successful Gold videos, Wall captures the audience’s attention
right from the start by employing hooks that are interesting and hint at the
general framework for a narrative. In his top videos, Wall relies on a
reasonable assumption—that the viewers are familiar with viral entertainment
content. By framing his hooks around popular subjects, he provides viewers
with sucient context to grasp the narrative direction, and the promise of an
undiscovered story or insight, thereby elevating their expectations.
For instance, in his viral video It’s Corn: Have You Heard is Viral Song,
which has amassed six million views and can be viewed at
http://guide.hookpoint.com/, along with all the other videos and references in
this book, Wall captivates his audience by featuring the well-known TikTok
song trend “It’s Corn!” He then piques viewer interest by hinting at a deeper

story: “But the people who made this song . . . have also made the biggest
songs on the internet. . . .” is Hook Point, a concept designed to capture the
audience’s attention as quickly as possible, inspires the audience’s curiosity
about the song creators, prompting them to eagerly learn more and continue
watching.
In contrast, Wall’s underperforming Bronze content often features unclear
hooks or introductions that fail to establish a clear narrative direction. In these
instances, he sometimes wrongly assumes that the audience shares specic
background knowledge.
A case in point is the follow-up video to It’s Corn: Have You Heard is
Viral Song. e follow-up video, It’s Corn: Have You Heard is Viral Song Part
2, only brought in 256,000 views. is video underperformed because Wall
assumed that viewers had seen the rst video about the song “It’s Corn.” As a
result, he didn’t invest enough in creating a compelling introduction, leading
to a lack of viewer interest in learning more about the creators of the song.
Take e Biggest Series Debut HBO’s Ever Had, which only has 146,000
views as another example. is content primarily attracted a niche audience, as
most people lack a strong emotional connection to HBO’s streaming service
itself, unlike the bond they might have with a specic song or show. Also, the
visual presentation is overwhelming, displaying numerous intellectual
properties (IPs) simultaneously. As the camera swiftly pans across the screen
while Wall speaks, it becomes dicult for the audience to absorb all the details,
resulting in a lack of one central focal point.
To maximize viewer engagement, aim to craft a Hook Point that can
attract the masses within the rst three seconds of your video and that promises
to unearth an untold story or new revelation. Make sure your Hook Point
builds sucient context and sets a clear narrative direction. is approach will
raise audience expectations and increase the likelihood they’ll watch your

content to the end. For a deeper dive into Hook Points, explore my book,
Hook Point, which you can nd at http://guide.hookpoint.com/.
Introducing the Deep Cut
Introducing the deep cut, or lesser-known stories, into your narrative
builds tension and makes viewers feel like insiders. ese stories captivate
viewers because they trigger an “Oh, wait, what?!” reaction, keeping the
audience engaged. Wall masterfully achieves this eect by gradually unveiling
unexpected insights, with each revelation serving as a stepping stone toward
that next surprise. is builds layers of tension that hook viewers, keeping
them invested in an unpredictable narrative journey that gives viewers access
to exclusive information.
In his top-performing Gold videos, Wall excels at creating those
unexpected “Oh, wait, what?!” moments. Starting with stories that initially
appear predictable or familiar, he delves deeper to uncover hidden layers,
revealing often overlooked or underappreciated deep cuts that signicantly
impact the narrative. One frequent technique that Wall uses is exploring the
origins of a song, artist, or group, which usually leads him to interesting side
narratives. Each new layer adds to accumulating tension that keeps the
audience engaged. is continual unveiling of hidden insights—like being let
in on a secret—fullls the viewer’s craving for surprise and discovery.
For example, in the mega-viral video Pogo—Forget (Slowed Down), which
has garnered more than 21 million views, Wall delves into the viral trend
behind this video and reveals lesser-known stories behind the trend’s origins.
e viral trend of using the song “Pogo—Forget (Slowed Down)” in a TikTok
dance where a partner dodges a stick held by the other partner (reminiscent of
scenes from e Matrix) has an intriguing backstory. Many people believe that
the user shiro_snake not only sparked the trend with a video that garnered
nearly 40 million views but also created this song. Yet, Wall’s research revealed

something dierent: he found that another user, opppleeen, had posted a
similar video with the stick-duet dance two months earlier, attracting more
than 15 million views. Further digging showed that the song, available on
YouTube for over three years before the trend-setting video, is actually a
slowed-down version of a track from seven years prior. Intriguingly, this
original track was composed of chopped-up samples from various Disney
movies. is discovery sheds light on the complex and often-unknown
histories behind a viral sensation that many enjoy.
In Coco, which garnered 3.7 million views, Wall immediately grabs
attention with one of his signature hooks. is time, he delves into the behind-
the-scenes challenges faced by the creators of the beloved Pixar lm Coco. He
then dives into the story, focusing on the unexpected journey of the main
singer and voice actor for Miguel, the young protagonist of Coco.
Interestingly, we discover that he was initially rejected for the part and was
only intended to do scratch vocals while they looked for the ocial voice actor
for the character.
In contrast, Wall’s less successful Bronze videos miss the mark by failing to
explore untapped layers or by skimping on research. Although he may
introduce central tension, he doesn’t incorporate additional micro-tensions
within the narrative, focusing solely on one story thread. Unfortunately, this
single thread often zzles out, failing to build adequate anticipation. Instead of
layering multiple compelling stories, Wall tends to elongate a single,
moderately interesting narrative beyond its natural conclusion.
For example, in e Biggest Series Debut HBO’s Ever Had, which only
generated 146,000 views, Wall explores the success of HBO’s show House of
Dragons and its relationship to the massively popular series Game of rones.
Although many viewers naturally assume that House of Dragons drew
inspiration from its predecessor’s triumph, Wall’s discussion doesn’t oer much

more than mildly interesting statistics comparing the audience sizes of the two
shows. e video falls short in exploring additional layers of the narrative, such
as the creative challenges faced during production or the strategic decisions
that led to the new show’s success or failure.
In Lizzo which received only 260,000 views, Wall covers the initial lack of
success of one of Lizzo’s hit singles, “About Damn Time.” Given that the song
eventually became a hit, and the audience is already familiar with its ultimate
rise to popularity, the video fails to oer any new or unexpected insights. e
narrative falls short in delivering the “Oh, wait, what?!” moments that are a
hallmark of Wall and the Untold Stories format. It fails to delve into the less-
explored nuances of the story, missing an opportunity to uncover deeper
insights. As a result, the video doesn’t hold the same level of intrigue or
tension, compared to his more successful pieces that unravel lesser-known
narratives.
Some ways to uncover deep cuts and explore lesser-known or overlooked
aspects within familiar stories in your eld or niche involve doing the
following:
1. Research nuances, side narratives, or hidden details to provide
fresh insights and captivate your audience. (For example, one of
Wall’s most common research themes involves the Origin Stories
of hit creations, artists, or groups.)
2. Reframe a linear, logical story in a less obvious manner. Consider
what the standard way to tell a story is, and then craft scripts that
deviate from that norm.
3. Share unexpected revelations or exclusive information to which
you may have access.

Additionally, don’t overlook the importance of stacking tension. Instead of
xating on a single story, weave in multiple micro-tensions within your
narrative. is could involve exploring dierent angles, perspectives, or
subplots that contribute to the larger resolution.
Overcoming Obstacles with High Stakes
Focusing on narratives that showcase overcoming high-stakes obstacles
creates underdog stories that are both relatable and tension building. ese
narratives tap into the universal human desire to witness triumph in the face of
adversity, resonating with viewers who identify with the struggle. e
heightened stakes add a layer of suspense, as the characters’ lives or careers
depend on overcoming these challenges. As a result, viewers are more likely to
stay engaged, eagerly anticipating the potential for a life-altering victory or a
heartbreaking setback.
In his Gold Videos, Wall focuses on individuals who defy the odds as
underdogs, achieving unexpected success. With a keen eye for detail, he selects
stories that naturally embody the underdog narrative or reframe a seemingly
successful character who had to overcome hidden challenges. By skillfully
emphasizing the signicant stakes involved, Wall not only builds anticipation
but also sets the stage for transformative outcomes that can make or break the
artists’ careers.
For example, in Have You Heard is Viral Song, Mr. Telephone Man, with
7.7 million views, Wall follows a child who went viral for covering a song
from the ’80s. is viral video led to a string of successes for the young artist,
including a starring role in a Broadway play.
In another video, Let’s Talk about the Problem Every Artist Has, which
garnered more than 9.3 million views, Wall presents Elton John as an
underdog ghting the notion that older artists can’t recapture their past glory.

is unconventional angle shows the struggles even superstars face against
societal pressures.
In contrast, the less successful Bronze videos lack the essential elements of
transformation and stakes. ey fail to mention what’s on the line, and as a
result, don’t inspire viewers or position them for a satisfying payo.
For example, in How Artists Got eir Name, with just 88,000 views, Wall
discusses how the British rock group Coldplay chose their name. However, he
fails to explore the name’s impact on their success, leaving the narrative feeling
emotionally at.
To craft videos that resonate deeply, look for stories that naturally embody
or can be reframed to showcase the underdog narrative. Remember, the
underdog story is just one example; other compelling themes might include
coming-of-age, self-discovery, perseverance, love and relationships, and
overcoming fear. Importantly, make sure to emphasize the stakes involved,
and clearly articulate the way in which they can set up your audience for a
satisfying emotional payo.
Delivering Impactful Conclusions for Characters
e power of content often lies in its conclusion. A well-crafted ending
that resolves tension with impactful conclusions for characters or intriguing
insights for the audience leaves viewers feeling impressed, and inspired to share
the content. e act of sharing plays a crucial role in a video’s virality, as it
helps extend its reach and capture the attention of algorithms.
Simply maintaining viewers’ attention until the end may not inspire them
to click “Share,” though. ey need to perceive value in the content—
something they believe will also enrich the lives of their friends and family. In
this context, sharing isn’t a one-way street. Although it certainly amplies

Wall’s reach, it also allows viewers to feel good about sending valuable content
to their social network.
Wall excels at providing value in two principal ways: First, he oers
meaningful entertainment through engaging stories. ese narratives resonate
with viewers, evoking emotions and connecting them to the experiences of the
characters. Second, he delivers insider insights that make viewers feel both
special and privileged. By sharing exclusive information or unique
perspectives, he taps into their desire for knowledge while creating a sense of
exclusivity.
In both scenarios, Wall skillfully resolves the narrative tension, leaving
viewers with a satisfying payo, which is amplied by the journey they’ve just
taken.
All of Wall’s Gold videos in this storytelling framework either delve into
unexplored nuances of traditional stories or feature characters who confront
signicant obstacles, leading to an insightful or impactful resolution.
Let’s look at the Gold Videos within these two main categories:
1. e underdog videos: Wall showcases stories of performers and
entertainers who face daunting challenges, revealing how
overcoming these obstacles leads to transformative decisions
with signicant impact. e implications feel life-changing for
the individuals involved. roughout the story, Wall subtly
hints at the life-changing consequences but only conrms these
implications at the very end. For example, in his video e
Biggest Song Was Meant to Fail, which boasts more than 3.3
million views, Wall narrates the unexpected success story of
OneRepublic’s song “I Ain’t Worried,” featured in the lm Top
Gun: Maverick. Interestingly, the song wasn’t intended to be

the movie’s hit, initially overshadowed by Lady Gaga’s “Hold
My Hand.” However, “I Ain’t Worried” gained viral popularity
due to its association with a TikTok video showcasing a clip
from the movie that features actor Miles Teller’s abs. Wall also
explores OneRepublic’s tumultuous journey through the music
industry. e band was dropped by Columbia Records just two
months before their rst album’s release. Unfazed, the lead
singer used MySpace to release the band’s music, leading to
their rise as the number-one unsigned act on the platform. is
success eventually led to a deal with Timbaland’s label, marking
the start of OneRepublic’s journey in creating numerous hits.
Additionally, in Let’s Talk about the Problem Every Artist Has,
which has amassed more than 9.3 million views, Wall discusses the
challenges musicians face as they age, particularly noting their
diculty in replicating the success they achieved in their youth. He
highlights how Elton John successfully navigated this challenge by
sampling four of his own songs to create a new hit, “Cold Heart,”
with Dua Lipa, earning him his rst top-10 hit in more than 25
years. Wall also explains how Elton John repeated this successful
formula by sampling three of his songs in collaboration with Britney
Spears on “Hold Me Closer,” which also provided her with an
opportunity for a comeback.
2. e origin-story videos: ese oer a unique and rewarding
experience, delving into behind-the-scenes insider stories of
popular hits and artists. is content climaxes with intriguing
revelations, gifting viewers with exclusive insights. For example,
the video Pogo—Forget (Slowed Down), which has garnered

more than 21 million views, uncovers the background story of
a song released seven years prior that unexpectedly became a
viral trend. Another notable video in this series, Netix-
Wednesday?, with more than 11 million views, explores the
TikTok trend of using Lady Gaga’s “Bloody Mary” in relation
to the Netix program Wednesday. Interestingly, the song isn’t
featured in the show. Wall reveals how actress Jenna Ortega
choreographed her dance scene in Wednesday to a dierent
song, “Goo Goo Muck” by e Cramps, which is more than 40
years old and also went viral due to the show’s popularity. ese
revelations in both videos arm the audience’s belief that their
time spent watching was worthwhile.
In contrast, Wall’s low-performing Bronze videos lack both
impactful insights and compelling narratives. ey don’t have the
depth or the intrigue that sets his Gold videos apart. Often, these
videos follow overused or predictable storylines that lack tension,
resulting in unsatisfying endings. For example, e Biggest Series
Debut HBOs Ever Had with a modest 126,000 views, fails to oer
any intriguing details about the origin of House of the Dragon
beyond the fact that it’s a Game of rones spin-o and performed
well despite backlash against the latter’s nal season. Another
example is How Artists Got eir Name, which garnered only 88,000
views. It underperformed because it stops short of explaining how
Coldplay transitioned from its original name, Starsh, leaving
viewers somewhat disappointed.

FORMAT STRATEGIES—SECTION 5
THE 30-DAY-CHALLENGE VIRAL
FORMAT (LONG FORM)
e success of the 30-Day-Challenge format is attributed to its balance
between personal experience and universal appeal. Matt d’Avella, a well-
known YouTuber and documentary lmmaker with more than 3.4 million
subscribers and 300 million views, serves as an excellent example of someone
who has adeptly mastered this format. He’s undertaken various self-
improvement challenges, demonstrating his commitment to pursuing a
meaningful life through small steps, simple habits, and gradual growth. His
content serves as a prime example of how to chronicle self-improvement
journeys in a way that informs and inspires audiences.
Among the challenges d’Avella has undertaken include quitting sugar for
30 days and taking only cold showers for a month. ese challenges are
designed to push his boundaries and encourage personal growth. By
documenting his experiences and sharing them with his audience, he oers
valuable insights into his journey while also encouraging others to take on
their own paths of self-improvement.
In addition to quitting sugar and taking cold showers, d’Avella has also
undertaken a variety of other challenges, such as adopting a vegan diet for a
month and reading 30 books in 30 days. Each challenge comes with a unique
set of obstacles and lessons. His authentic and candid style in his videos
resonates deeply with viewers.

e performance-driver hypotheses my team and I have developed with
respect to what leads to virality in this format include:
1. Accessible, actionable, and novel topics
2. External research
3. Lighting and composition
4. Storytelling and the Jenga eect
5. Dynamic energy
ACCESSIBLE, ACTIONABLE, AND NOVEL TOPICS
One of the keys to mastering the 30-Day-Challenge format is selecting an
accessible, actionable, and novel topic. Viral content within this format
features challenges that are achievable for anyone with enough willpower and
interest, without requiring special skills or costly equipment. In top-
performing Gold videos, the duration of the challenge is carefully aligned with
the task’s diculty, ensuring that it’s challenging but achievable. For example, a
30-Day Challenge to quit sugar or take cold showers is tough but doable. In
contrast, attempting to free dive in deep water without the proper training can
lead to drowning, shallow-water blackouts, or decompression sickness, making
it extremely unsafe and dicult for most people to accomplish.
e top-performing content also inspires viewers to attempt new
challenges they might not have thought of otherwise. Although challenges
focusing on well-known paths of self-improvement may fail to grab attention,
novel challenges such as taking cold showers have the opposite eect. ese
intriguing topics naturally spark curiosity about the potential benets of such
challenges, prompting viewers to explore the content further and perhaps even
take up these tasks themselves.

EXTERNAL RESEARCH
Gold creators enhance the credibility of their challenges by integrating
expert interviews, charts, graphs, and supporting statistics. Many of the videos
adopt a documentary-style approach and feature expert content, enriching the
audience’s learning experience.
Including expert interviews provides viewers with authoritative insights and
perspectives, adding depth and credibility to the challenge. ese experts
contribute valuable tips and advice, enhancing the challenge’s legitimacy.
e use of charts, graphs, and supporting statistics strengthens the
challenge’s validity and its potential benets. is data-driven approach appeals
to the viewer’s logical side, increasing their trust in the information and their
willingness to undertake the task.
Documentary-style narratives oer a compelling storytelling experience
that engages the audience emotionally while presenting the challenge in a well-
structured and informative manner. is format allows for a more immersive
and educational viewing experience.
By incorporating these tactics, Gold creators not only make their
challenges more convincing but also increase the educational value of the
content, making it more eective in connecting with the masses.
LIGHTING AND COMPOSITION
In Gold content, lighting and composition play a crucial role in creating a
visually engaging experience. Talented creators pay attention to detail,
ensuring that each shot oers three-dimensional depth with a sharp
foreground, a softer midground, and a background. is careful arrangement
mimics our natural, real-life perspectives and contributes to a comfortable
viewing experience.

ese lighting and composition techniques allow top creators to enhance
the viewing experience without the need for an elaborate production team or a
large budget. e sharp foreground draws the viewer’s attention to the main
subject or challenge, while the slightly blurred midground and background
add depth and dimension, enhancing the storytelling aspect.
e result feels like an intimate conversation with a friend. e visual
depth and composition create an authentic atmosphere that fosters a sense of
connection between the viewers and creators. It feels as though we’re right
there, engaging in a discussion about the bold idea of undertaking a weeklong
fast with them.
is thoughtful use of lighting and composition not only enhances the
overall viewing experience but also keeps the audience engaged from start to
nish. is attention to visual detail plays a key role in the content’s success,
drawing viewers in and sustaining their interest throughout the video.
STORYTELLING AND THE JENGA EFFECT
e Jenga Eect is a powerful storytelling strategy (explained in depth in
Part I), for building suspense and engagement in viewers. Like pulling blocks
from a Jenga tower, this technique involves progressively introducing new
elements and challenges to build tension and anticipation.
As each new twist or obstacle is added, viewers become more invested in
the subject’s journey. e unexpected elements keep the audience engaged, as
they want to know how the challenges will be navigated or resolved.
Creators strategically manage tension and release throughout the video,
creating a roller-coaster-like experience for the viewers. Each introduced
obstacle heightens tension, drawing viewers into the story and leaving them
eager for the resolution.

Using the Jenga Eect, creators maintain a dynamic, exciting, engaging
narrative that keeps viewers hooked. As the suspense builds, viewers become
increasingly connected to the subject’s journey, eager to watch until the end to
see how it all unfolds.
DYNAMIC ENERGY
Top-performing Gold creators use a diverse range of shots, captions,
images, and segments to create dynamic shifts in energy that captivate and
sustain viewer attention. Instead of presenting their content chronologically,
viral creators structure their videos around specic obstacles they encounter
during their challenges. is creates a more immersive experience that makes
the viewer feel like an active participant rather than a passive observer.
e dynamic approach not only keeps audiences engaged but also builds
empathy for the creators’ struggles and triumphs. By showcasing the highs and
lows of their self-improvement journeys, they invite us into their world and
keep us emotionally invested in their progress.
e use of appealing visuals—such as meticulously framed shots and eye-
catching images—enhances the storytelling and adds visual allure to the
content. Cleverly placed captions and segments further elevate the
entertainment value, making the viewing experience both informative and
engaging.
is format’s focus on specic obstacles rather than a linear chronology
gives the videos a dynamic, suspenseful quality. is makes viewers eager to see
how each obstacle will be overcome, which builds anticipation and maintains
engagement throughout the entire video.
By sharing their journeys in this compelling manner, Gold creators not
only entertain and inspire but also create a sense of community among their

audience. Viewers become emotionally invested in the creators’ progress and
are often encouraged to undertake their own self-improvement challenges.
30-Day-Challenge Gold Content
I Quit Sugar for 30 Days, which can be watched at
http://guide.hookpoint.com/, along with all the other videos in this book, is a
challenging feat that few would willingly tackle. Yet for the vast majority, it’s
an attainable goal. In this compelling video, d’Avella, with 3.4 million
subscribers, guides us through his sugar-free month, providing meticulous
detail that immerses viewers in his physical and emotional journey.
To enhance the credibility of his message and add value to the video,
d’Avella includes an interview with an expert nutritionist who explains the
signicant health benets involved in reducing one’s sugar intake. ese well-
informed insights add a layer of authenticity, making viewers feel as if they’re
gaining valuable knowledge from the video.
Visually, the video utilizes lighting and composition to create engaging
depth that captivates the audience. Close-ups of d’Avella’s face communicate
the reality of his struggle without the need for many words. e inclusion of
supportive graphics reinforces viewer retention and comprehension, making
the information more accessible and digestible.
e video’s storytelling is driven by dynamic shifts in energy to chart the
highs and lows of d’Avella’s experience, maintaining viewer engagement and a
strong connection between the creator and the audience. e 30-day duration
of the sugar-free challenge strikes a well-calculated balance: it’s long enough to
potentially produce noticeable physical changes while remaining approachable
for a general audience.
I Took Cold Showers for 30 Days, which has garnered more than 6.3 million
views, was based on research from the book e Flinch by New York Times

bestselling author Julien Smith. is research-backed health improvement plan
elevates the challenge beyond a simple stunt, adding value and appeal for the
viewers.
e video showcases d’Avella’s skillful use of visual composition, even
during scenes of cold showers, enhancing the overall viewing experience. e
inclusion of B-roll footage—which is supplemental or alternative footage
intercut with the main shot, featuring topic experts—further enhances the
dynamics of the video by providing additional insights and expertise.
e 30-day time frame aligns well with the diculty of taking cold showers
daily. It allows adequate time to experience the potential benets and changes
without becoming excessively long or overwhelming for participants.
In What Happens If You Don’t Eat for 10 Days? which has garnered 3.3
million views, the creator narrates his experience with a 10-day fast. e
skillful use of the Jenga Eect builds tension and anticipation throughout the
video, drawing viewers deeper into the unfolding narrative. is successful
storytelling technique not only keeps the audience engaged but also boosts
retention rates, as viewers are eager to see the challenge’s resolution.
Also, the solid visual execution, including compelling shots and
compositions, enhances its overall impact. e 10-day time frame of the fast is
short enough to maintain interest while emphasizing the challenge’s diculty,
elevating the content to Gold-level status and making a lasting impression on
the audience.
30-Day-Challenge Bronze Content
e low-performing Bronze content in this format lacks dynamic
storytelling, research, visual depth, and interesting or accessible challenge
types. For example, Goal Guy’s Cold Weather Workouts, with 107,000 views,
presents an intriguing challenge but limits its appeal to viewers living in cold

climates or those who are already physically t. Additionally, many residents of
such climates might already engage in cold-weather activities and view them as
regular parts of their routine, not as novel challenges. us, the content may
not seem particularly interesting or unique to them. Also, although the video
mentions research, it misses the opportunity to include visual aids such as
charts and graphs, which negatively aect viewer engagement.
Harshibar’s I Quit Social Media, with only 15,000 views, structures its
narrative chronologically rather than around specic obstacles. is approach
lacks the suspense-building quality achieved by techniques like the Jenga
Eect.
Nathaniel Drew’s 30 Days No Alcohol with 144,000 views, falls short in the
visual depth department. e primary shots appear at and two-dimensional,
lacking the appropriate distance between the subject and the camera. Also, the
subject’s face occupies less than half of the screen’s vertical height, missing the
eectiveness of a tightly framed shot.
e Unlazy Ways’ challenge video, 30 Books in 30 Days, which has
garnered 61,000 views, presents an impossibly short time frame that may be
unrealistic for the average viewer. On the other hand, their I Ditched Coee for
100 Days, with 96,000 views, features a signicantly longer challenge duration.
is extended time frame might discourage viewers from even considering
giving up their favorite beverage, potentially making the challenge less
appealing.

FORMAT STRATEGIES—SECTION 6
FROM THEORY TO ACTION:
PUTTING YOUR CONTENT TO
THE TEST
Congratulations on completing another section of this book! Knowledge is
only half of the equation, though; application is what truly makes the
dierence. By continually comparing your work to Gold-level content, you
will eectively reinforce the principles that make it highly successful and
shareable. Let’s dive into another round of benchmarking to keep rening
your skills. Here’s how to do just that:
1. Create another video: Develop a piece of content using a strong
reference video that uses a clear Viral Format. You can choose one
from this section of the book or select a reference that you nd
on your own. If you choose your own, ensure that you conduct
thorough research to fully understand the key performance
drivers and their nuances before attempting to replicate the
format.
2. Compare your completed video with your Gold reference
before you post it: Open up your video next to your high-
performing Gold reference video.
3. Run the checklist: Go through a performance driver checklist.
While doing so, remember that although certain elements are
common across various content formats, each one possesses a

unique combination of these features. When comparing your
video, be conscious of which format you’ve selected, and focus on
identifying the questions that are relevant to your chosen format.
If you chose the Visual Metaphor format, for example, compare your
video with one of Dr. Julie Smith’s high-performing Gold-tier videos.
Assess how eectively you’ve incorporated the key performance drivers.
ese include: the impact of the First 3 Seconds, the use of an Active
Metaphor, the creation of Tension, the use of Potential Energy, the
introduction of a Perspective Shift, incorporating Cleverness, and the
inclusion of Immediately Applicable Insights.
Remember, the performance drivers listed below are specic to the Visual
Metaphor format. If you’ve chosen a dierent format, you’ll need to identify

and focus on a distinct set of performance drivers. My team and I have
compiled a general list of elements to consider below, but remember, not
every element may apply to your chosen format. Use the research and
evaluation skills you’ve learned so far to accurately assess your content and
create a format-specic list of criteria. As you complete this exercise, be
constructively critical, nd room for improvement, and also give yourself
credit for the aspects you’ve handled well. Here are some performance drivers
to consider:
1. e First 3 Seconds: Does your video start with a hook that
immediately grabs the viewer’s attention and establishes the
context for what’s to come?
2. Generalist Principle: Have you intentionally incorporated
universal themes or common human experiences in your content
to appeal to the masses? Are you approaching your audience as if
they have no prior knowledge of your subject matter? Are you
selecting broad and relatable topics as focal points? Are you
steering clear of intricate terminology or jargon, and ensuring
that any new terms are clearly dened for the audience? Are you
framing your topics as stories, with conicts and obstacles, to
draw viewers into the narrative?
3. Perspective Shift: Does your video oer a powerful revelation or
aha moment that challenges viewers’ perceptions? Evaluate if it
debunks misconceptions, presents new ideas, or highlights
dierent viewpoints. Ensure that it prompts a transformative shift
in viewers’ perspectives, compelling them to reevaluate the topic
in a way that challenges their preconceived beliefs or views.

4. Viewer Connection: Does your video establish a personal
connection with viewers, acknowledging their perspectives? is
includes:
Maintaining eye contact.
Addressing the viewer directly using you. Keep in
mind that you’re talking to one person on the other
side of the screen.
Framing your content or message from an average
viewer’s point of view.
Predicting what the viewer might think or feel about
something you share. Anticipate the viewer’s internal
monologue, and try to speak to it.
Providing actionable value, leaving the viewer
thinking, I’m glad I watched that.
Oering educational insights that impart new
knowledge and satises the viewer’s curiosity.
5. Tension Building: Does your video eectively build tension,
compelling viewers to anticipate what will happen next? Be sure
that it introduces not only a main problem but also minor
problems leading to the resolution of the initial issue. Can you
incorporate a Completing the Scale eect, delivering a satisfying
resolution to the narrative or message? is can include visual
cues that make viewers eager to see the next shot, pivotal shifts in
the storyline, and a compelling narrative with a buildup and
payo that holds the audience’s attention. Conrm that the initial
setup serves as a hook, generating anticipation and curiosity and
motivating viewers to stay engaged until the resolution is reached.

6. Incorporating Cleverness: Have you infused your content with
cleverness? Assess if it includes ideas that are both unexpected and
smart, potentially by logically linking two unrelated concepts.
Consider whether you engage the audience with witty language or
ideas, creating memorable experiences that subvert expectations
and elicit the reaction, Why didn’t I think of that?
7. Element of Absurdity: Does your content include elements of
absurdity? Experiment with incorporating aspects that are
unexpected, ridiculous, or illogical to captivate the audience’s
attention and create a memorable experience. Although not all
formats utilize absurdity, this technique is particularly eective
when used correctly and in conjunction with cleverness.
8. Eect on the Viewer (EOV): Prior to utilizing any tactic, did you
consider the eect it will have on viewers? ink about the
emotions and thoughts you want to evoke after they’ve watched
your content. Begin with the desired outcome and plan
backward, strategizing how to achieve this eect.
Continual Improvement
Once you’ve gone through the checklist, note what’s missing or could be
improved in your video. Use this feedback for immediate renements, or
incorporate it into your next project. Repeat this process until your video
checks all the boxes and stands up to a Gold-level comparison.
By putting your content to this rigorous test, you’ll ensure that it not only
meets but potentially exceeds the standards of what makes a video go viral. If
you keep honing your craft and iterating based on these principles, you’ll be
well on your way to creating content that not only resonates with viewers but
also leaves a lasting impact.

PART III
THE COMMUNICATION
ALGORITHM
The Power of the Communication Algorithm
Now that you’ve learned how to analyze, research, and identify viral videos,
I’m excited to introduce another pillar in our method for achieving Viral
success: the Communication Algorithm. is tool, deeply rooted in the
principles of the Process Communication Model (PCM), oers a pathway to
impactful, large-scale communication for every piece of content you write,
create, and speak. Developed by Dr. Taibi Kahler, a renowned psychologist
and author, the algorithm draws insights gathered from over 1.6 million
individuals globally. Its, eectiveness is evidenced by its adoption across
leading organizations—NASA, Bill Clinton, Coca-Cola, BMW, IKEA,
L’Oréal, and Pixar—to fulll ambitious communication and business
objectives.
In this section, we delve into mastering communication at scale. At Hook
Point, our mission is to guide our diverse clientele in integrating the PCM
into their social media content eectively, broadening the resonance of their
messages. A common challenge in communication is the inclination to convey
messages in a manner that resonates personally, rather than universally, often
leading to reduced audience reach due to personal biases in language and
structure.
e Communication Algorithm is instrumental in rening our vocabulary,
sentence structure, and body language, signicantly enhancing our ability to

connect with a larger portion of the population. With many content creators
struggling to engage more than 30 percent of their audience on social media,
this algorithm serves as a transformative solution. It not only identies the
language and messaging that truly engages a wide audience, but magnies the
impact of their communication eorts. By leveraging this innovative
approach, businesses can forge meaningful and lasting connections, far beyond
mere reach.
is section seeks to enhance your understanding of communication
preferences by presenting the Five Rules of the Communication Algorithm for
eective communication at scale. ese guidelines aim to reveal potential
blind spots that could limit your ability to connect with the masses.
Recognizing that individuals express themselves through various styles—such
as facts, opinions, feelings, imagination, fun, or actions—is crucial. Notably,
prioritizing Feelings, Facts, and Fun, while steering clear of Values-Based and
Autocratic communication styles, is key to engaging with up to 85 percent of
the population.
By adopting the Communication Algorithm and its core principles, you’ll
be well-equipped to navigate the intricacies of large-scale communication,
ensuring your messages not only reach but truly resonate with a vast and
diverse audience.

THE FIVE RULES—SECTION 1
HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE THE
WORLD
Individuals communicate using six distinct methods, each with a vocabulary
preference that operates on both conscious and subconscious levels. We
naturally gravitate toward our preferred mode of communication. e six
communication styles are as follows:
1. Feelings
2. Facts
3. Fun
4. Opinions
5. Imagination
6. Actions
It’s crucial to recognize that while we possess the capacity to utilize all six
styles, we typically favor one. is preferred style not only inuences our
decision-making but also serves as our primary means of connection and
comfort. It guides us as content creators in our expression and engagement
strategies, and it inuences how the audience connects with and responds to
our content.
Below you can see that 75 percent of the population wants their content
delivered with feelings, facts, and fun.

THE BIG THREE:
THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION
Feeling-based communicators make up the largest subset of the population,
at 30 percent. ey are emotion-based and connect with brands and content
through feelings, making purchasing decisions based on emotional
connections. Phrases that resonate with them include “I’m comfortable with,”
“I feel,“ “I care,” “I love,” “I’m happy,” “I’m sad,” and “We are close.”
Fact-based communicators make up the second-largest group, at 25 percent
of the population. is group highly values data and concrete information.
ey appreciate language such as “I think,” “Which options,” “Time frames,”
“details,” “Does that mean . . . ,” “Who . . . ,” “What . . . ,” “When . . . ,”
“Where . . . ,” “. . . facts” “. . . information,” and “data.”
Fun-based communicators are the third-largest subset, making up 20
percent of the population. ey are motivated by fun and excitement and are
drawn to content that elicits reactions. ey highly value humor, spontaneity,
and creativity. ey express their opinions readily, using phrases such as “I love

it!” “I hate it!” “Wow . . . ,” “I like . . . ,” “I don’t like . . . ,” “I don’t want . . . ,”
“I feel like,” “I don’t feel like,” or “is is awesome!”
ese three personality types—Feeling, Facts, and Fun—are pivotal to
engage with if you aim to make your content go viral, as they represent 75 percent
of the population. e key to satisfying all three lies in incorporating a blend of
facts, feeling, and fun in your content.
THE LITTLE THREE:
THE SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION
Opinion-based communicators make up 10 percent of the population and
are values focused. eir decisions are deeply rooted in trust toward individuals
and content, and they evaluate people and situations through their opinions
and belief systems. Loyalty and commitment are paramount to them.
Opinion-based communicators often ask questions such as, “Can I trust this
brand?” and “Do they share my values?” eir language frequently includes
phrases such as “In my opinion . . . ,” “I believe . . . ,” “We should/must/need
to . . . ,” “. . . respect,” “. . . admiration,” “. . . commitment,” and “. . .
dedication.”
Imagination-based communicators, who also make up 10 percent of the
population, are introspective individuals who often engage in reection.
Unlike other groups, they tend to internalize rather than overtly react, mulling
over their thoughts and feelings as they visualize interactions with products or
services. ey value privacy and personal space and appreciate specic
guidance and clear directions before taking their next steps. eir language
often includes phrases such as “need time to reect,” “need more direction,”
“hold back,” “visualizing options,” “Imagine the possibilities,” “Envision,”
“easy pace,” “my own space . . . ,” and “don’t want to rock the boat . . . .”

Action-based communicators make up 5 percent of population and are
action-oriented individuals. ey are goal driven and favor quick results,
responding positively to directives that lead to immediate decision-making.
Preferring action over prolonged discussions, they value initiative, adaptability,
persuasion, charm, and self-suciency. e language that this group uses is
rm and direct and includes phrases such as “Go for it!” “Bottom line,” “Best
shot,” “Enough talk,” and “Make it happen.”

THE FIVE RULES—SECTION 2
THE FIVE RULES OF THE
COMMUNICATION ALGORITHM
Welcome to this detailed guide on the Five Rules of the Communication
Algorithm. Mastering these rules equips you to connect with 85 percent of the
population, paving the way for extensive engagement. If you’re curious why
the ve rules don’t reach 100 percent of the population, it’s because
communicating in the style of imagination, opinions, and action alienates the
other 75 percent of the population. Similarly, adopting a communication style
focused on opinions and values can disengage 90 percent of people. erefore,
we use the ve rules to engage 85 percent of the audience, which is the highest
achievable percentage.
e rst three rules address the Big ree communication preferences—
Feelings, Facts, and Fun—resonating with 75 percent of the population. is
foundation allows content creators to engage a broad and diverse audience. By
also embracing the principles of Non-Values-Based and Non-Autocratic
Communication, as detailed in the nal two rules, your reach expands to an
impressive 85 percent of the population.
Data from over 1.6 million communication assessments collected globally
validate the eectiveness and ease of applying these ve rules. Often, you can
implement multiple rules within seconds, signicantly enhancing your
message and audience reach. However, neglecting Rules 4 and 5 might restrict
your audience, as 85 percent of people resist imposed values or directives.
Nonetheless, selectively incorporating autocratic elements—contrary to Rule 5

—can be eective, particularly when balanced with the other four rules. While
ideally all ve rules would be applied, using three to four of them still ensures
meaningful engagement.
Remember, while this section provides numerous tips, not all advice will
apply universally. Your strategy should be inuenced by various factors, such as
the nature of your content, subject matter, video length, and other
considerations. We oer a range of strategies to suit dierent communication
styles, allowing you to choose those that best t your unique approach, target
audience, and personal preferences in expression and presentation.

communication style. So Rule 3 (you guessed it) is creating content that
appeals to them.
Fun-based individuals are spontaneous, energetic, playful, and creative.
ese people are drawn to content that oers lighthearted and enjoyable
experiences. ey value playfulness, amusement, spontaneous moments, and
genuine reactions.

TIPS FOR INTEGRATION INTO YOUR CONTENT
Natural reactions: Fun-loving individuals value shared experiences.
Showcase genuine reactions in your content—marked by energy,
dynamic tone variations, full-body engagement (movement) when

“Don’t want to rock the boat . . .”
“Not sure . . .”
2. Steer clear of monotones or dull expressions.
3. Refrain from starting sentences with You to avoid placing undue
responsibility on the listener. An eective solution is to rephrase
the sentence by positioning you in the middle or toward the end.
Instead of saying, “You should try this new
productivity app!” you might rephrase it as, “Yo, this
new productivity app has been a total game-changer
for me—you wanna check it out?” or “I’d love to
show you this helpful productivity app that’s
streamlined my day. Are you interested in seeing it?”
TIPS FOR BODY LANGUAGE, GESTURES, AND FACIAL

2. Try not to sport tense or blank facial expressions that lack
enthusiasm or warmth.
3. Steer clear of static camera shots or monotonous talking-head
presentations.
Rule 4: The Rule of Non-Values-Based Communication
Rule 4 advises against using values-based communication. is style centers
on personal beliefs and opinions, as seen in statements like “Our supplement is
the best on the market” or “Meditating with our app makes you a better
person.” Such communication appeals to merely 10 percent of the population,
nding resonance mainly among those who share similar viewpoints. Yet, it
struggles to connect with the overwhelming majority—90 percent—of people,
as it can alienate listeners by presenting potential areas of disagreement. For
example, emphasizing environmental conservation as a top priority could
repel someone who prioritizes economic growth, thus signicantly narrowing
the communicator’s potential audience.
CHALLENGES OF VALUES-BASED COMMUNICATION

e key reasons why values-based communication is not the most eective
approach include:
Limited appeal: It resonates with a very small segment of the
population, limiting its eectiveness.
Risk of opposition: By nature, it invites counterarguments,
fostering division rather than connection.
ese challenges show the importance of adopting more inclusive
communication strategies. Such strategies steer clear of polarizing values and
opinions, aiming instead to unite and engage with the masses.
FROM VALUES-BASED TO INCLUSIVE COMMUNICATION:
EXAMPLES
Transforming values-based statements into more inclusive communication
can help engage the masses. e objective is to transition from values-based
communication to methods that embrace Feelings, Facts, or Fun. ese styles
promote more inclusive and engaging interactions.
Many brands and inuencers, often without realizing it, employ values-
based language on their landing pages and social media platforms. e table
below presents examples and suggests alternative phrasings that uses Feelings,
Facts, or Fun.
Values-Based Alternative
“Something needs to be done
about climate change.”
“I’m worried about the changing climate.”
(Feelings)
“Do you want to know the latest info on
climate change?” (Facts)
“is climate change thing is freaking
CRAZY!” (Fun)

“e rst-gen version of this hard
drive is better because of the sturdy
case, even though the new one has
better specs.”
“I love the rst-gen version of this hard drive.”
(Feelings)
“e rst-gen version of this hard drive has a
hard-shell external casing that gives you
protection that the new product doesn’t oer.”
(Facts)
“e rst gen version of this hard drive is o
the hook amazing!” (Fun)
“Our supplement is the best on the
market.”
“We have a supplement product just for you.”
(Feelings)
“Per ‘X’ research done on our supplement, we
have data to prove we have more vitamins and
nutrients than our competitors’ products.”
(Facts)
“More nutrients is just what the doc ordered .
. . just sayin’!” (Fun)
“If you want to be a better person,
you have to meditate.”
“Quiet, comfortable, and soothing meditation
may help you.” (Feelings)
“Meditation has been shown by ‘X’ research to
benet many people’s lives. Here is a link to
that research. . .” (Facts)
“Meditation, dude. Love it or hate it . . . it
might just help ya out!” (Fun)
“To become a good content
creator, you have to work with
Hook Point.”
“Hook Point would love to help you go viral.”
(Feelings)
“Hook Point has helped ‘X’ creators go viral.
Here’s a link to those creators . . .” (Facts)
“Wanna get your viral content exploding . . .
Hook Point!” (Fun)
“You shouldn’t be eating that.” 
“We have a healthy eating plan tailored just for
you.” (Feelings)
“Do you want information on how to eat
better?” (Facts)

“Yo, that stu is bad for you, dawg.” (Fun)
Adopting a non-values-based approach in communication allows for a
broader and more inclusive engagement, reducing the potential for alienation
and fostering a more open dialogue. is strategy is crucial for connecting
with a wider audience, particularly in contexts where building a consensus or
mass appeal is essential.
Rule 5: The Rule of Non-Autocratic Communication
Autocratic communication involves directing someone explicitly, often
seen in online sales pitches like “Buy now or miss out on this incredible oer!”
is style is characterized by directives that allow little room for others’ input,
thus restricting dialogue and the exchange of ideas. In today’s global context,
an overwhelming 85 percent of the population resists this direct approach,
preferring not to be explicitly told what to do. is signicant preference
underscores the importance of Rule 5.
One can easily visualize this rule by imagining a parent instructing their
children to come to dinner in 15 minutes, only to nd them still preoccupied
later. is common scenario mirrors a broader truth: a considerable number
of individuals, both young and old, instinctively resist being told what to do, a
sentiment that goes beyond personal interactions to the digital realm.
ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION STYLES
Instead of relying on Autocratic Communication, consider one of these
three preferred styles—Benevolent, Democratic, and Laissez-faire
Communication—each oering a unique approach to engaging with others:
Democratic Communication: is style involves asking and
consulting with the other party, promoting a sense of participation
and respect for their opinion. It values the listener’s input and

decision-making process, encouraging open dialogue for a mutual
exchange of ideas and opinions. Preferred by 35 percent of the
population.
Benevolent Communication: Conveys warmth, care, and
acceptance, focusing on a nurturing and empathetic tone that
considers the listener’s feelings and needs. Favored by 30 percent of
the population.
Laissez-faire Communication: Emphasizes creative, spontaneous,
and playful language. It’s laid-back and engaging, presenting the
receiver with a relaxed and informal manner. Appreciated by 20
percent of the population.
SELLING A LOBSTER EXAMPLE
Consider using content creation to market lobsters. Instead of employing
Autocratic Communication with directives like “Buy this lobster” or “Purchase
this lobster for a discount,” opt for Benevolent, Democratic, or Laissez-faire
Communication styles. For instance:
Democratic Communication might ask: “Would you like to
purchase this lobster?”
Benevolent Communication could express: “We’re excited to oer
you this special lobster deal.”
Laissez-faire Communication might casually suggest: “Hey, we’ve
got some amazing deals on lobsters!”
FROM AUTOCRATIC TO ALTERNATIVE: EXAMPLES
Our goal is to shift from autocratic language to approaches that
incorporate democratic, benevolent, or laissez-faire styles, which foster more

inclusive and engaging interactions.Many brands and inuencers, often
unknowingly, use autocratic language on their landing pages and social media
platforms. In the following sections, you’ll nd examples, along with
alternative ways to convey the same message Democratically, Benevolently, or
in a Laissez-faire manner.
A common eective approach involves reframing statements into
questions. is invites readers to engage with the idea, subtly conveying the
content creator’s intention to provide value and interact with their audience:
Autocratic Alternative
“Buy now or miss out on this
incredible oer!”
“We have an oer for you.” (Benevolent)
“Do you want to check out our best oer
yet?” (Democratic)
“Our oers are the bomb right now!!!”
(Laissez-faire)
“Act fast and secure your spot!”
“We want you to secure your spot.”
(Benevolent)
“Would you like to take advantage of our
limited-time oer?” (Democratic)
“Spots are disappearing like MySpace.”
(Laissez-faire)
“Don’t think twice; click here for
instant access!”
“We dropped the prices this weekend just for
YOU.” (Benevolent)
“Do you want to save money this weekend?”
(Democratic)
“Dropping that price for a sizzling weekend!”
(Laissez-faire)
“Sign up now!” 
“We would love it if you signed up now.”
(Benevolent)
“Do you want to sign up?” (Democratic)

“Gotta sign up to show up!” (Laissez-faire)
“Subscribe to our newsletter or miss
out on the latest updates!”
“Our newsletter is created to help you.”
(Benevolent)
“Do you want to stay updated with the latest
news?” (Democratic)
“Click! Sign! Bang! . . . you got the
newsletter.” (Laissez-faire)
“Get our product now and start
experiencing the dierence!”
“We have a new experience just for you!”
(Benevolent)
“Do you want our new product?”
(Democratic)
“New experience! New product . . .what,
what!!!” (Laissez-faire)
“Upgrade to our premier package!”
“We want you to sign up for our premier
package.” (Benevolent)
“Do you want to unlock our top-tier
resources?” (Democratic)
“Upgrading is like driving your dream car . .
.” (Laissez-faire)
Direct commands often act as a disincentive in communication, a
sentiment echoed by the vast majority. By avoiding Autocratic
Communication and embracing Benevolent, Democratic, and Laissez-faire
Communication styles, you can align more closely with the preferences of 85
percent of the population. Learning to adapt to diverse communication
preferences is crucial when trying to go viral online.

THE FIVE RULES—SECTION 3
APPLYING THE COMMUNICATION
ALGORITHM TO YOUR CONTENT
AND MARKETING PLANS
Understanding your own communication styles, as well as those of your team
members and your customers, is invaluable. It provides a foundation for
enhanced engagement with your core audience. Consider a situation where
your marketing director and your primary customer share similar
demographics:

Although they look the same on paper, their communication styles are
totally dierent:
e bars in the graphics above indicate the level of energy each individual
possesses for each communication style. A longer bar represents more energy,
which translates to their communication strengths and the predominant
language they’re likely to use. Conversely, a shorter bar signies less energy,
highlighting their communication weaknesses and the language they’re less
likely to use.
Even though everyone has access to all six communication styles, each
person has distinct strengths and weaknesses in various styles, and we tend to
predominantly use our strongest ones. If your marketing director excels in
action-based communication but struggles with feelings-based
communication, while your core customer is strong in feelings-based

communication but weaker in action-based communication, a disconnect
arises. e marketing director might create content that emphasizes urgency
and calls for immediate action, which will not resonate with a core customer
seeking an emotional connection.
In this scenario, the marketing director’s content might look like: “is is
the best. You need to act now or you’re going to miss out,” which fails to
connect with the feelings-based core customer, who desires emotional
engagement. Such a disconnect can be problematic. In this example, the
marketing director’s natural communication style could potentially alienate up
to 95 percent of the brand’s core target audience because action-based
communication typically resonates with only 5 percent of the population: the
Promoters. is gap represents lost opportunities and revenue. Importantly,
this isn’t a critique of the marketing director’s skills but rather, highlights the
need to be cognizant of varying communication styles and to adapt content to
reach the widest audience eectively.
Or imagine a scenario where your marketing director is a values-based
communicator and crafts marketing copy from that perspective, they also risk
alienating 90 percent of the population. is is because the vast majority do
not appreciate content lled with beliefs or heavy opinion-based words like
“need,” “should,” and “ought,” as these do not allow them the choice or
opportunity to decide for themselves. It’s too forceful for them. Statistically,
what people desire is to feel good about the content, to nd it logical, or to
perceive the advertisement or copy as hip, cool, and awesome—essentially the
antithesis of “should,” “ought,” “need,” and “we believe.”
Consider the direct sales posts on the internet or social media as an
illustrative example. is content often appears on our screens with a bold,
hard-sell approach, using language that commands immediate action, such as
“Buy now!” or “Limited oer—click to purchase!” While this strategy may

generate quick sales from a segment of people who respond to urgency, it
often fails to appeal to a wider audience that prefers a more nuanced and
interactive experience. e direct, hard-sell approach can be o-putting to
many and may alienate those looking for authentic engagement and
informative content. Adopting this forceful tactic without considering the
diverse preferences of the masses could inadvertently narrow your brand’s
reach, capturing only a small portion of the potential market.
e issue is not the content per se, but rather, the language used, which fails
to address Fun, Facts, Feelings, and the Benevolent, Democratic, and Laissez-
faire communication styles that resonate with the masses. By understanding
e Five Rules of the Communication Algorithm and leveraging the most
desired communication styles, you can better engage your audience, thereby
maximizing your impact and success. Remember, how we say something is
often more important than what we say.
Selling a House Analogy
To illustrate the importance of diverse communication styles, consider the
process of selling a house: Typically, Realtors list properties by just stating facts:
a “4BR/3BA home, 2,300 square feet, located at [address], oered at [price].”
But this approach only appeals to people who interact primarily through facts
and overlooks a broader audience.
By adding to the description so it incorporates all ve of the
communication algorithm rules, the listing becomes more eective:
4BR/3BA home, 2,300 square feet, located at [address], oered at
[price] (Facts)
We would love to show this comfy cozy home. (Benevolent)
A home with warmth, and a coziness that feels like you never want
to leave.

(Feelings)
ere’s a pool out back where you can host the most amazing
parties! (Fun)
Do you want to live near excellent local schools? Here’s a link with
the data about the schools in this neighborhood. (Democratic)
is hip spot won’t last long . . . let me know when you wanna
check it out. (Laissez-faire)
By incorporating elements that cater to Facts, Feelings, and Fun, and by
using Benevolent, Democratic, and Laissez-faire communication styles that
avoid values-based and autocratic approaches, the advertisement is likely to
resonate with at least 85 percent of the population, reaching beyond just the
fact-driven individuals. is strategy follows the principle that language, when
thoughtfully applied, can broaden appeal and inclusivity, thereby amplifying
impact and success.

THE 5 RULES—SECTION 4
THE COMMUNICATION
ALGORITHM BREAKDOWN: HOW
DR. JULIE SMITH MASTERS
TIKTOK WITH VIRAL MENTAL
HEALTH CONTENT
In a world where social media platforms are ooded with dance videos and
lighthearted content, making serious and informative topics go viral can
appear daunting. Yet, Dr. Julie Smith, the clinical psychologist and author
mentioned earlier in this book, has challenged this idea. She skillfully uses e
Five Rules of the Communication Algorithm to blend Feelings, Facts, and
Fun, avoiding value-based and autocratic language to create viral mental
health content on TikTok. With millions of followers, Smith reaches a wide
audience with her empowering messages about mental health.
Her video on trauma therapy, Trauma, which can be viewed at
http://guide.hookpoint.com/, along with all the other videos and references
mentioned in this book, has already garnered more than 10.5 million views.
In it, she uses crumpled paper and a wastebasket to symbolize how therapy can
help individuals process traumatic experiences.
Smith skillfully captivates the 20 percent of her audience drawn to
entertaining and dynamic content. She does this with subtlety and nesse
rather than silliness and exaggerated antics, but she incorporates fun elements
with engaging aesthetics, such as a vibrant, rainbow-themed backdrop that

exudes warmth and creates an inviting atmosphere. Avoiding over-the-top
gestures, she opts for creative props and playful movements that are both
charming and relatable. rough her interactions with the props mentioned
above, she evokes tactile sensations that allow viewers to almost feel the
experience themselves. e satisfying sound of paper crinkling as she smooths
out the pieces, along with the visual of neatly folded paper being placed back
into the wastebasket, enriches the sensory experience. is nuanced approach
shows that connecting with the segment of the population that enjoys a fun
communication style can be gracefully achieved without leaning on humor.
Adding to the video’s eectiveness, Smith also incorporates valuable facts
and insights, resonating with the 25 percent of viewers who value logical, fact-
based content. Her skillful use of framing (the placement and positioning of
subjects in a particular camera shot)—leaning into the camera and
maintaining eye contact—enhances the video’s emotional impact. is
strategic framing creates an intimate, one-on-one conversational atmosphere,
strengthening her connection with the 30 percent of her audience who
appreciates feelings-based communication. Additionally, Smith’s warm facial
expressions and emotionally resonant content further appeal to this
emotionally responsive segment of the audience.
By adeptly combining these elements, Smith succeeds in resonating with
75 percent of her audience, each in their preferred mode of communication.
It’s important to note that these elements are blended subtly; they don’t need
to be over the top or exaggerated to be eective. Clients often think that
separate videos are necessary to appeal to each personality type. Smith
demonstrates, however, that Feelings, Facts, and Fun can be used together with
nesse, signicantly contributing to a video’s viral success.
In another example, Smith’s Stress Bucket video, which has garnered more
than 1.2 million views, uses a vivid visual metaphor: a bucket lled with water

to symbolize stress levels. As she outlines various ways to manage and alleviate
stress, she uses a drill to release water from the bucket. is imaginative visual
metaphor not only drives home the concept of stress management but also
oers viewers an unforgettable takeaway.
e video’s physical movement and prop interaction engage the 20 percent
of the population that responds to fun and playful content. e satisfying
sound of the drill and the comical spilling out of the water amplify the
entertainment value. Simultaneously, Smith’s warm and open facial
expressions connect with the 30 percent of viewers who are more responsive to
emotional communication. Once again, she subtly yet eectively addresses
both fun and feeling in this video.
Additionally, she provides logical, useful, and informative content,
appealing to the 25 percent of the audience who value fact-based
communication. By skillfully incorporating Feelings, Facts, and Fun, Smith
crafts yet another hit video that resonates with 75 percent of her audience.
In both videos, she avoids using value-based language such as “should,”
“ought,” and “need,” steering clear of imposing conditions on what one must
do to be of value. Rather than preaching, she opts for explaining (appealing to
fact-based communicators), describing (catering to feelings-based
communicators), and demonstrating (engaging fun-based communicators).
Also, she steers away from autocratic language that dictates actions to her
viewers. Instead, she uses a mix of Benevolent, Democratic, And Laissez-faire
language, exemplied by sentences like “Let me introduce you to the stress
bucket” (Benevolent); “So, what can we do about that?” (Democratic);
“Sometimes that stress might be a little trickle, but other times it is thick and
fast!” (Laissez-faire). is approach is crucial, as 85 percent of the global
population does not want to be told what to do but prefers an invitation to
make their own decisions.

Smith’s remarkable success on TikTok stands as proof that any topic can
resonate with the masses. For content creators, the Communication Algorithm
serves as an invaluable tool for building authentic, meaningful connections
with viewers. So go ahead—have Fun . . . and Facts and Feelings . . . to
captivate and inspire your audience!
