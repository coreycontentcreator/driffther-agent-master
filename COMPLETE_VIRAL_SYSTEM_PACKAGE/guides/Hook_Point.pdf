FOREWORD
Greek American engineer, physician, and entrepreneur Peter Diamandis
(best known for being founder and chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation)
once famously said that if you’re holding a smartphone in your hand today,
you have more access to information than the president of the United
States did in the late 1990s. The smartphone gives every single individual
on Earth the ability to make an impact through knowledge acquired by
research or through the sharing of messages that influence people, politics,
and business. In other words, the sum of human knowledge is now in the
palm of your hands.
Access to this vast amount of information is a gift, but it also creates a
problem—most people feel inundated, overwhelmed, and stressed out
because of the sheer magnitude of content flowing to them on a daily basis.
In 1970, 500 ads were seen by the average American per day; 
1 
today it’s
between 4,000 and 10,000 ads per day.
2 
This has led to a phenomenon
where human attention spans are getting shorter. These days, if you want

xii HOOK POINT
to get your message out to the world, you often have as little as three sec-
onds to do so.
Think about it. The world’s first contact with your brand or business is
often on social media, where there are 147,000 photos uploaded, 54,000
shared links, and 317,000 status updates on Facebook every minute;
3 
more
than 95 million posts shared on Instagram every day; 
4 
and one billion
hours of content watched on YouTube daily
5
—there’s an incredible amount
of distraction that prevents you from being seen. Whether you like it or
not, if you want people to notice your brand or business—online or off—
it’s essential to master the art of grabbing attention quickly.
Luckily, Brendan Kane is a true expert in helping people stand out.
Brendan’s claim to fame happened when he decided to figure out how he
could get one million fans in 30 days flat. After that achievement, he wrote
a book about the process called One Million Followers. The book led to
speaking opportunities, which is how I met Brendan, when I put him
onstage at Mindvalley’s A-Fest to share his knowledge about digital and
social media. I was so impressed by what he had to share that I asked him
to become an adviser for my company, Mindvalley.
In a matter of months, Brendan transformed the way my team and I
communicate on the internet. He gave us the incredible ability to boost
our company’s revenue—as once you have a loyal following, you can get

important messages out there, which ultimately helps you monetize that
following. As a health advocate, one of the most important messages
Brendan has helped us communicate to date was about the harmful effects
and outlandish marketing claims of Coca-Cola. He guided us in launching
a campaign with a video on the dangers of high-fructose corn syrup that
amassed ten million views within a week (and it’s still growing).
In short, not only did Brendan’s ideas help our company thrive, but they
also allowed us to disseminate important information, impact the con-
sciousness of our audience, and become more effective activists. This is
why it’s so important to know how to stand out—you can have all the
followers in the world, but to truly make a difference you need to know
how to communicate with them.
This book will give you a process that helps you better communicate
with potential audience members and business partners, as well as with
current customers. You will learn how to make them loyal, engaged, core
visionaries who support your visions, ideas, and mission. To get you started,
here are some crucial tips about making an impact that I’ve learned as I’ve
grown my following and reach for Mindvalley:
1. Be aware of whom you’re talking to. Tailor your communication
to your audience, whether it’s millennials, baby boomers, or an
ultraniche group of people such as auto mechanics.
2. Become your demographic. Mine comprises people who are pas-
sionate about transformation, health, and personal growth.
Every single month I make it a point to read, attend a program
or seminar, and work with a transformational leader. I put myself
through experiences that make me wiser, healthier, and happier.

xiv HOOK POINT
Then, I share these experiences with my audience so that I am
not only a mentor and a thought leader but also a member of my
demographic—a consumer of transformation.
3. Know your why—that is, know why you do what you do. I do
what I do because of what I call the “Eve question.” Eve is my
six-year-old daughter, and before every action I take, I ask myself,
“Will this make the world better for Eve?” This is why my com-
munication is not just about spreading personal-growth infor-
mation, but also about encouraging people to leave the world a
better place for all the young children who will inherit this
planet.
4. Be authentic and real. In my communication, I don’t just share
ideas from my business, I also openly share my difficulties and
challenges. My most-commented-on and engaged posts over the
last two years were the ones where I spoke about personal
events—how my parents lost their home in a fire, how I was
recovering from a serious injury and would have to go through a
year of rehabilitation, and even a post where I shared why my
partner and I were ending our marriage. People demand authen-
ticity from leaders today and pay more attention when you’re
real and authentic.
Brendan covers all these tips in depth (and so many more) in this book.
I bet you’re eager to start reading, but before you embark on this journey
to making an impact, I want to address one hurdle that may be in some of
your minds: Am I worthy of sharing? Am I unique or special? Do my thoughts
really need to be heard?
The answer is: You won’t know until you try. So why not start today?

Foreword xv
In 2008, when I first started my company, I only published other peo-
ple’s work. Even though I had considerable expertise in certain fields, I felt
I was too young, too unworthy, and too unaccomplished to publish my
own thoughts. I didn’t feel good enough until a disaster struck several years
later—I lost a deal with my biggest author. All of a sudden, there was a gap
to fill, and I decided that perhaps it was a sign I should step up and become
an author myself. When I did so, the universe seemed to support my
choice. Not only did my book, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, become
a New York Times bestseller, but it hit the number-one spot on Amazon. Yet
this was a book that I had put off writing for three years because I didn’t
think I had what it took!
All of us will face moments of insecurity and doubt—moments where
we feel unworthy. Know that these moments are often nothing more than
self-imposed limitations. So get out there and do your best. You will refine,
grow, and enhance your ideas when you let them flow out to a world that
will dissect, comment on, engage with, and mold them. Let public opinion
and feedback become your friends. No matter where you are, put your
insecurities aside, and just do it. You’ll get better as you practice the tools
that Brendan Kane shares right here in this book.

INTRODUCTION:
LIVING IN A 3-SECOND WORLD
Digital and social media have reshaped our world into one of micro-
attention. With more than 60,000,000,000 messages sent out on digital
platforms each day, we have an incredible amount of information being
sent to us constantly. Whether it’s a text, a push notification, an email, an
advertisement, or a social media post, our brains have to adjust to process-
ing larger amounts of content than ever before. In fact, the average person
spends 11 hours a day interacting with digital media (including digital
video, audio, TV, newspapers, magazines, etc.) 
6 
and scrolls through 300
feet of content.
7 
People use their phones 1,500 times a week and check
their email in-boxes 30 times an hour.
8 
Every 60 seconds on Facebook,
there are 400 new users, 317,000 status updates, 147,000 uploaded

photos, and 54,000 shared links.

Approximately 95 million photos and
videos are shared on Instagram on a daily basis.

More than 500 hours of
content are uploaded to YouTube each minute, 
11 
and around 40,000 songs
are uploaded to Spotify every single day. 
12
This bombardment of stimuli has changed the way we process informa-
tion and communicate with each other, both online and off. New research
from presentation software company Prezi says that we’re becoming more
selective about what we devote our attention to; and Latham Arneson,
former vice president of digital marketing at Paramount Pictures, has been
a close witness to this shift in communication. He says, “Before social
media you had fewer sources for people to pay attention to. While there
was still a lot of information being shared, today the inundation of plat-
forms forces marketers to compete harder than ever before. There’s a lot
more distraction.”
Erick Brownstein, president and chief strategy officer of Shareability,
who’s created digital content for soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, the
Olympics, Adobe, AT&T, and many other major corporations and celeb-
rities, agrees, saying, “Now there’s not only more content, but also better
content. You have competition for limited time and attention, and many
messages get lost in an avalanche of distraction.”

Introduction: Living in a 3-Second World xix
Brownstein adds that today, even if you’re planning on advertising on
the side of a bus or on a billboard, it’s important to think about what will
make your marketing material shareable in a digital ecosystem. In your
storytelling process, you need to think through a social media and digital-
first lens as it influences the types of stories you’ll tell and how you’ll tell
them. Doing so will make your messages more palatable to audiences that
have higher expectations imposed by our new climate.
Serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk backs this up with his belief that
we are grossly underestimating the power of the internet. He says, “If you
don’t adapt to the shifts in consumer attention, you’ll lose. There are so
many people who are wasting money in marketing every single day because
they’re chasing what ‘used’ to work. But the reality is, the tactic that used
to work yesterday will put you out of business today.”
13
In response to all these changes in our behavior, Facebook started count-
ing video views at three seconds instead of when it initially loads in the
feed. They did so because advertisers were up in arms when they saw that
they were being charged for views when most people were just scrolling
past the feeds and not paying attention to their ads for more than a second.
Facebook video product manager Matt Pakes believes that three seconds
indicates a person’s intent to watch a video, saying, “If you’ve stayed on a
video for at least three seconds, it signals to us that you are not simply
scrolling through [the] feed.”
YouTube creator Hank Green has criticized Facebook’s video view stan-
dard, saying that Facebook is “muddying the waters by calling something a

xx HOOK POINT
view when it is in no way a measure of viewership.” 
14 
But regardless of
who’s right in this debate, Facebook’s choice affects the way we consume
content on Facebook and Instagram, and it can’t be ignored. Facebook’s
(and the majority of social platforms’) algorithms are designed to push
content that grabs and holds people’s attention. Most videos don’t get past
the 3-second mark, so the algorithms help prioritize the best content that
actually maintains people’s attention.
By examining my own behavior and speaking with marketing profes-
sionals and friends during the research for this book, I have come to realize
that the world has changed. My attention span is certainly shorter. Content,
ideas—even people—have to work harder to stand out. If you can’t capture
people’s attention in that first three seconds, or whatever short time period
you have with them, then you can’t get them to pay attention to the rest of
your story, products, or services. And that’s why this book is focused on
how to develop Hook Points—a method to grab people’s attention in the
first three to five seconds, both online and off, so you can win the next 10,
15, 30, or 60 seconds to convey the rest of your message.
Learning how to capture attention successfully is the skill that people
like Vaynerchuk most attribute their success to.
15 
He explains that your
ambition should always be to get the attention of the end consumer, and
that building a real relationship with your audience is how you achieve
lofty goals. For example, Kylie Jenner built a strong relationship with her

social audience and leveraged that attention to sell 51 percent of her busi-
ness for $600 million. 
16 
This happened because she knows how to capture
attention and maintain relationships at scale.
A lot of people know who they are and what they do—a few even know
why they do it (as concept author and motivational speaker Simon Sinek
eloquently writes and teaches about, and which we’ll discuss later on in this
book). But even when brands or individuals have clarity in these areas, they
often struggle to maintain a potential audience’s attention long enough to
get them to learn about the individual or brand. Many people have amaz-
ing products or services but fail to achieve great success because they don’t
know how to talk about what they do effectively. As Brownstein points out,
people generally care about themselves, not your brand, product, or busi-
ness. If you constantly put your brand in the spotlight of your marketing
material, people will tune it out. Ever been on a date where the other per-
son talks about him- or herself the whole time? Boring! Brands are doomed
to fail if their main focus is on selling themselves. Instead, they need to
think about how to bring value to their audiences.
This new reality presents marketers with serious challenges. How do you
get past all the noise? In my first book, One Million Followers: How I Built
a Massive Social Audience in 30 Days (www.OneMillionFollowers.com), I
focused on teaching readers how to fight algorithms and how to create
compelling content to drive massive scale and audiences on the various
social platforms. In this book, I walk you through my Hook Point process,
which helps you capture attention in the 3-second world in which we live

so you can generate new opportunities, innovate and scale your business,
and create a compelling brand that works both online and off.
Knowing how to use Hook Points properly helps you become a more
effective marketer and communicator. It gives you a nucleus upon which
to scale your business and become a world-class brand. It’s a critically
important business tool that deserves marketers’ time and attention.
Whether I’m talking to a young adult who’s just graduated from col-
lege or a well-seasoned billionaire, I find that people at both ends of the
spectrum struggle to identify how to package their messages in succinct,
attention-grabbing ways that work in our 3-second world. Unfortunately,
not knowing how to do so leads to missed opportunities.
I wrote this book because I truly believe that understanding how to use
Hook Points can help individuals, businesses, and brands stand out and
reach their goals more quickly and with more consistency. These are the
first topic I address with clients, as they can largely enhance success.
A great Hook Point will not only allow you to capture people’s attention
in three seconds, but it will also help you hold that attention to get your
audience to take specific actions for years to come.
I help people stand out with the Hook Point process every single day, so
if at any point you’d like additional assistance in understanding how to
stand out and innovate your company, or have a question about any topic
in this book, feel free to email me at bkane@brendanjkane.com, or visit

CHAPTER 1
MEET HOOK POINT,
YOUR NEW SECRET WEAPON
Every time you scroll through your phone, read the news, turn on your
TV, listen to the radio, or look at a billboard, you’re inundated with mes-
sages, content, and advertisements. To actually stand out and capture atten-
tion, you need an effective Hook Point or you’ll get lost in the noise. So
what is a Hook Point? A Hook Point can be comprised of text (e.g., a phrase,
title, or piece of copy), an insight (from statistics or a professional’s point of
view, a philosophy, or a person’s thought), a concept/idea or a format (e.g.,
an image or video), a personality or performance (e.g., music, sports, act-
ing, or a cadence), a product/service, or a combination of some or all of
these elements. It is used both online and/or offline to grab an audience’s
attention in the shortest possible amount of time. (If you wish to dive in
deeper and see visual examples of some of the most common types of Hook
Points, please visit: www.hookpoint.com/training.)
My team and I often aim for a Hook Point to capture a person’s atten-
tion in three seconds or less, especially when designing content for digital
and social platforms. A Hook Point’s purpose is to help you get people
interested in learning more about your content or business—it can help

2 HOOK POINT
you generate new leads, launch products successfully, generate social fol-
lowers at scale, drive massive revenue growth, create effective brand mes-
saging, secure high-paying job interviews, perform well in important
meetings, land A-list clients, and/or achieve other career-related goals and
aspirations.
The term Hook Point is derived from many different concepts in adver-
tising and branding over the past hundred years. I do not claim to have
invented all the ideas connected to this concept. I’ve simply reframed and
redefined what was once considered a hook line, a magazine headline, a
“lead,” or a “big idea” (among a variety of other terms in branding) to fit
our current digital micro-attention culture.
Most great pieces of advertising start with a solid Hook Point. This is
because they’re designed to get people to lean in. Brand strategist Craig
Clemens (follow him @Craig on Instagram), one of the top copywriters in
the world (selling more than $1 billion in products) and the cofounder of
Golden Hippo, a leader in direct-to-consumer marketing, grew up learn-
ing from some of the best copywriters in advertising. One of his favorites
is the legendary Gary Halbert. Halbert’s most famous campaign was cre-
ated to launch a perfume line by Tova Borgnine, the wife of movie star
Ernest Borgnine. Halbert wrote an ad in a newspaper to announce the
launch party at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. He used the head-
line: “Tova Borgnine Swears Under Oath That Her New Perfume Does
Not Contain an Illegal Sexual Stimulant,” with the subhead: “Wife of
famous movie star agrees to give away 10,000 samples of her new fragrance
just to prove it’s safe to wear in public.” More than 7,000 people showed
up at the hotel, and more would have probably barged in had the fire mar-
shals not stopped them.

Meet Hook Point, Your New Secret Weapon 3
The results that this hook produced were incredible—the campaign led
to purchase orders from the biggest department-store chains, and the event
was written up in Time magazine. As a result, the Borgnines went from
grossing $20,000 a month to $800,000 a month (and this was back in
1977, so it was probably worth ten times that today due to inflation).
17
Clemens believes that this hook had such effective results because it tapped
into the truth that people wear perfume to impress and attract the opposite
sex. Halbert took that idea to the extreme to hook people with the con-
cept that this perfume causes so much attraction that it’s hard to believe it’s
not illegal.
Ernest Lupinacci, legendary copywriter, cofounder of ad agency
Anomaly, and founder/chairman of the board of Ernest Industries, shares
that one of his favorite Hook Points is from a long-copy ad for Timberland
boots: “Your eyes are frozen. Your skin has turned black. You’re technically
dead. Let’s talk boots.” Lupinacci says that the writer apparently got the
idea by looking up the definition of hypothermia and then wrote a headline
that summarized the symptoms in a very dramatic way. Then he wrote
an essay about hypothermia and wove in the various innovative features
and design elements of the boots. The ad captured the attention of those
who wanted to engage in outdoor activities but didn’t want to freeze to
death in the process. Lupinacci adds that the drama of the hook helped
people understand the ad right away—they didn’t even need to read the
rest of the copy—which demonstrates just a bit of the power of a great
Hook Point.

4 HOOK POINT
Hooks have been an important part of copywriting for as long as I can
remember, but now, in our 3-second world, they’re even more essential.
Lupinacci explains that for people who work in traditional advertising, “it’s
getting harder to make breakthrough TV commercials because brands are
competing with a nearly inexhaustible amount of content, which includes
viral videos, almost every film ever made available on streaming sites, and
an unimaginable quantity of quality television programming. To make
matters even more difficult, all of this content is on-demand.”
Because of these realities, Lupinacci emphasizes that pulling off a com-
mercial like Jeep’s “Groundhog Day,” which was created for the 2020 Super
Bowl (which you can watch here: www.brendanjkane.com/Groundhog),
was a remarkable accomplishment. Not only was the commercial charm-
ing, funny, flawlessly executed, and true to “the passion and irreverence of
the Jeep brand,” but viewers understood why Jeep was inserted into the
Groundhog Day story—it worked. Although the Jeep Rubicon was not the
star of the spot, it was (along with Bill Murray and the groundhog) the
perfect costar, and a crucial part of the ad. To that end, Lupinacci com-
mends Highdive, O PositiveFilms, and Jeep for delivering a great piece of
branded content “that did what every piece of branded content should do,
which is to focus on branded utility,” and demonstrating how a brand can
be useful or meaningful to a consumer’s life.
At the end of the day, this ad worked because it had a great hook.
Without the hook that the Super Bowl took place on Groundhog Day, and
that Bill Murray was the star of a movie about this subject as well as the
spot, the ad wouldn’t have had as much success. Mike Jurkovac, Emmy
Award–winning director/producer at TheBridge.co, believes that using
these hooks helped Jeep “win the Super Bowl.” He also adds that the hook
was effective because Bill Murray embodies the Jeep brand—he’s true to

Meet Hook Point, Your New Secret Weapon 5
himself and a little bit quirky—he has the characteristics that connect the
dots for someone who would buy a Jeep.
Great hooks need to be used regardless of where you distribute your
marketing messages. When people scroll on Facebook, YouTube, or
Instagram, so much more varied content bombards them than in the old
world, where they only saw content in print or on television based on
selected topics. This volume of content makes marketers’ jobs harder,
though the goal remains the same. Jurkovac agrees, saying, “There are lit-
erally thousands of different publishers and distribution points, whether
it’s the TV, your tablet, your phone, or a magazine stand—there’s much
more content, so breaking through is hard.” Doug Scott, former president
of Ogilvy Entertainment and current president of Big Block, adds, “Social
media is causing marketers to reevaluate how they develop, produce, and
deliver content that can be monetized through social engagements across
multiple platforms.”
Hook Points are especially helpful for standing out within the online
clutter in today’s world and are essential tools for helping you compete
with clickbait. Clickbait captures attention but lacks substance. Using a
Hook Point is a better and more powerful choice because it’s always
attached to an authentic and compelling story that provides value and
builds trust and credibility (which I will cover in depth in later chap-
ters). A Hook Point is not like the content that used to be featured on
BuzzFeed, which, as Lupinacci points out, failed because “running click-
bait about the world’s largest rubber band ball wasn’t actually content
worth spending time with and didn’t help build a brand.” Instead, Lupinacci
advises that when you create Hook Points, you should have Dr. Ian
Malcolm’s voice (from Jurassic Park) in your head, saying something along
the lines of “scientists were so worried about whether or not they could

6 HOOK POINT
create dinosaurs that they didn’t consider if they should.” To apply this
concept to advertising in the age of clickbait, Lupinacci modifies the ques-
tion, asking, “This copy will get people to click on our ad, so we could
create it—but should we create it? Is this how we want to invest in our
brand?”
Most important, knowing how to create effective Hook Points not only
helps you grow your brand and stay relevant, but it can also help you sur-
vive. For example, perhaps if Blockbuster had known about and invested
in Hook Points, they wouldn’t have gone out of business. When Netflix
first launched, Blockbuster was their biggest competition. Netflix was
absolutely the David in this David-versus-Goliath situation but won the
market because they had stronger hooks.
The first hook they used was the fact that they delivered DVDs to your
door, and you could return them with no late fees. I discuss Netflix and
their Hook Point genius more in depth in just a bit, but for now I want you
to understand that Blockbuster failed because they didn’t come up with
any original hooks—they simply tried to copy Netflix’s, did so with less
finesse, and missed out on the most important hook, which was developing
strong, original content and inventing binge-watching around their origi-
nal content. In 2010, Blockbuster, a company once valued at $8.4 billion,
filed for bankruptcy and left Netflix to grow into a company with a market
cap of $140 billion (at the time of the writing of this book). The underdog
start-up was able to beat the major corporation because they had more
effective Hook Points.
We see a similar truth in Amazon’s rise to power. Amazon took away
market share from major stores like Borders, Radio Shack, Payless, Toys-
R-Us, Circuit City, Sears, and so on, by coming up with a plethora of
hooks, including the world’s largest bookstore (their very first hook),

Meet Hook Point, Your New Secret Weapon 7
one-click checkout, Amazon Prime, the Kindle, Sunday delivery services,
Amazon Echo, and more. The point here is that learning how to come up
with hooks through the Hook Point Framework can help you stay innova-
tive and survive in today’s market regardless of your current company’s size
or stature.
Remember, humans have always had short attention spans, and our new
micro-attention world reflects that truth. It continues to evolve at an
incredibly rapid pace because digital and social platforms have connected
us all and made information more accessible. As mentioned in the intro-
duction, we’re inundated with more than 60,000,000,000 messages each
day, making it more difficult for any of us to stand out. If you don’t capture
an audience’s attention within the first three seconds—or whatever short
period of time you’re given—you won’t get them to pay attention to the
rest of your story about your brand, product, or service. Additionally, it’s
important to realize that to build a long-lasting brand, you can’t just cap-
ture people’s attention once—you have to do it consistently. The Hook
Point Framework I will teach you in this book can help you grab people’s
attention to win the next 10, 15, 30, or 60 seconds (and beyond) to convey
the rest of your message time and again so that you don’t lose market share
and can continue to compete at the top.
BATTLE ROYAL: HOOK POINT VS. USP VS. TAGLINE VS.
POINT OF DIFFERENCE VS. MISSION STATEMENT
I’ve been asked if a Hook Point is the same thing as a unique selling prop-
osition (USP), tagline, mission statement, or a brand’s purpose. The answer
is: “Sometimes.” A USP “refers to the unique benefit exhibited by a com-
pany, service, product, or brand that enables it to stand out from

8 HOOK POINT
competitors.” 
18 
A tagline is “a short, memorable phrase that is used through-
out your marketing. It should convey the main sentiment or feeling that
you want people to associate with your brand.”
19 
Mission statements are
the values of a company, and a brand’s purpose is the reason it exists. In a
marketing campaign, a Hook Point must grab attention. If using your USP,
tagline, mission statement, or purpose works as your Hook Point by get-
ting people to pay attention, they could be the same.
For example, as mentioned previously, when Netflix first launched, their
biggest competition was Blockbuster, so the Hook Point that Netflix used
was the fact that they delivered DVDs to your door and that you could
return them with no late fees, which was also their USP. Then, later on, the
fact that they started producing original content such as House of Cards,
Orange Is the New Black, Stranger Things, and so on, also became their
Hook Points and USP. Another USP that served as a Hook Point was the
invention of binge-watching by releasing all of the episodes of a show at
once. In all these cases, the USPs worked well as Hook Points.
There are times, however, when USPs (as well as taglines, mission state-
ments, and a brand’s purpose) will not be the best choice for Hook Points.
A good example of a brand that has a different USP from their many Hook
Points is Disney. Disney’s USP is that they bring families together through
experiences and content. But this is quite general and isn’t the hook they
use in their marketing campaigns. Instead, they constantly develop many
different Hook Points to capture attention and to get people to watch

their movies and cable channels, and return to their theme parks, again
and again.
A Hook Point that Disney invested heavily in is Star Wars land. Few
people know the tagline or name of Star Wars land (which happens to be
Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge), but they do know that Disneyland and
Disneyworld opened a Star Wars–themed section of the parks, which gets
them excited about visiting. Disney had a bit of a rough start with this
hook—some people thought that it was responsible for an increase in ticket
prices, and others feared there would be longer lines for rides. (It will be
interesting to see how this hook plays out in the long run.) Regardless,
Disney has used entertainment content–related hooks for their theme
parks many times—a lot of their attractions (especially the newer ones) are
based on movies (e.g., Finding Nemo; Guardians of the Galaxy; The Little
Mermaid; Toy Story; Dumbo; Monsters, Inc., etc.) and characters dressed in
costume roaming the park to meet fans (e.g., Elsa from Frozen, Mickey and
Minnie Mouse, Snow White from well, Snow White, etc.). In fact, Disney
is currently working on launching a section of their theme parks specifi-
cally around Marvel movies. This is probably because the largest amount of
revenue for Disney, $26.23 billion in 2019, is generated from parks, expe-
riences, and products. Disney’s media networks fuel the theme parks, gen-
erating $24.83 billion in 2019; and studio entertainment (meaning their
movies) only accounted for $11.13 billion of the $71.54 billion they gen-
erated in 2019. 
20 
Because theme parks have proven to be such a strong
revenue driver, Disney is investing even further with acquisitions Pixar,

Marvel, and Lucasfilm—all tremendously strong hooks for Disney’s brand
and business.
21
Nike is a very clear example of how a brand’s Hook Points can be differ-
ent from their USPs, tagline, mission statement, and purpose. Nike’s tag-
line is “Just Do It,” and their shoes are their USP. Their mission statement
is “to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world,” 
22
while their purpose “is to unite the world through sport to create a healthy
planet, active communities, and an equal playing field for all.” 
23 
None of
these elements reflect Nike’s Hook Point. The Hook Points they use in
their marketing campaigns are aligned with their tagline, USP, mission
statement, and purpose, but the athletes and celebrities they sponsor, such
as LeBron James, Serena Williams, Kevin Hart, and Michael Jordan, are
the Hook Points that get people to pay attention to the brand in order to
learn more about Nike’s values. The connection to the athletes and celebri-
ties helps Nike generate press and publicity and allows them to express
their message in innovative ways. And it’s part of the reason why they’re
one of the biggest athlete sponsors in the world, spending more than $6
billion a year on sponsorship/endorsements
24 
. . . endorsements are an
important part of their hook, and it pays off.

lution of Nike’s Hook Points. He explains that when Nike first started out,

their Hook Point was that they made the best running shoes. As that hook
started to fade a little, they brilliantly started to use professional athletes
(remember, this was back in 1972 before endorsement deals were a huge
industry) as their Hook Points. Some of the first athletes Nike sponsored
were Romanian tennis player Ilie Nastase, a breakout star in Olympic track
and field named Steve Prefontaine, and basketball player Michael Jordan.
Now, they have a plethora of athletes they sponsor and always have new
Hook Points on the rise.
Most recently, the fact that the Olympics are considering banning Nike’s
Zoom Vaporfly running shoe has become an amazing Hook Point. Sports-
science journalist Alex Hutchinson explains that “the five fastest men’s
marathons in history have all been run in the last 13 months, all by runners
wearing Vaporflys.” Scientists think that Vaporflys give runners an advan-
tage by making them 4 percent more efficient, and that the shoe is seri-
ously helping them break records never before thought humanly possible.
25
This controversy is a great hook that makes consumers desire the shoe.
With each new Hook Point, who Nike is and what they do doesn’t
change. Their Hook Points simply evolve to continually grab people’s
attention to bring them back to the foundation of the brand. Hook Points
must evolve, because over time, culture and consumers change—Hook
Points adapt to meet their needs, but the core of Nike stays the same,
which is why their USP and tagline remain the same.
Another reason Hook Points change is because markets become satu-
rated, and brands need to find new ways to capture attention. What works

today won’t necessarily work six months from now, especially when com-
petitors catch on to it and attempt to use a similar hook. Nike understands
this fact and has become a master at evolving their Hook Points without
losing the core focus of who they are and why they exist—they never create
clickbait that captures people’s attention without substance to back it up.
All of their Hook Points are aligned with the core values of the brand; and
bring people into the story or context where a tagline, USP, mission state-
ment, or purpose can live and be provided with meaning.
GETTING IN THE DOOR WITH MTV, VICE, AND TAYLOR SWIFT
I’ve used the Hook Point process my entire career—it’s been a major key to
my success. Hook Points have helped me secure clients such as MTV,
Taylor Swift, Vice magazine, and Paramount Pictures; obtain book deals,
podcast interviews, television appearances; and allowed me to generate a
million social media followers in 30 days.
Although I’ve always been good at creating Hook Points, I didn’t realize
the magnitude of their importance until I moved to Los Angeles in 2005
to pursue a career in film. I started at the bottom as a production assistant
at Lakeshore Entertainment—a company responsible for producing mov-
ies such as the Academy Award–winning film Million Dollar Baby, the
Underworld franchise, and The Ugly Truth, among countless other films. At
the time, I felt like one in a million, lost in a sea of seekers; I thought it
would take me forever to make my way up the ranks in the movie industry.
But by following the process I outline in this book, in less than a year I was
head of Lakeshore’s first digital division. By listening and understanding
how to craft Hook Points and stories, which is precisely what I teach you

Meet Hook Point, Your New Secret Weapon 13
in this book, I communicated a strong hook and value proposition that led
to this fast promotion.
But just because it happened fast doesn’t mean it was easy. I was con-
stantly looking for ways to innovate myself and stand out. Over time I
realized that I wanted to forge a connection with Gary Lucchesi, the pres-
ident of Lakeshore. I was dropping off scripts to his office and heard him
speaking to his assistant one day: “I don’t understand why people just start-
ing out here don’t come into the office and ask me more questions.” He
had previously been the head of Paramount Pictures and a successful talent
agent for Kevin Costner, John Malkovich, and Michelle Pfeiffer. He knew
a lot about the industry and seemed to want to mentor people.
Once I heard him express his desire to answer questions, I tried to sched-
ule time with him, but his assistant wasn’t interested in fitting me in. To
bypass that obstacle, I started waiting outside of his office’s entrance, which
was located on the Paramount Pictures lot. I’d wait there at the close of
business every single day. If he was on the phone or he looked busy, I didn’t
interrupt him. But on those days when he would look at me and say hello,
I’d walk him back to his car and ask questions.
In the beginning, our conversations were focused on movie producing,
because initially that was what I wanted to do. I listened to his pain points
and tried to absorb everything I could. After a few weeks of listening
intently, I realized how I could provide him with unique value.
I worked up a conversation about my background. The Hook Point that
caught Lucchesi’s eye was that I’d started a few internet companies while I
was in college (which is rare), and also that I knew a lot about how digital
platforms worked. I showed him that I could help him market the movies
he was working on by using digital platforms effectively. Finding this insight

14 HOOK POINT
and presenting the proper Hook Point took me from making coffee and
copies as a personal assistant, to creating the first digital division of
Lakeshore in less than a year. From there, I started getting called into mar-
keting meetings and was brought into other studios that Lakeshore part-
nered with. Studios, directors, actors, and screenwriters started seeking my
advice on how we could promote films through social media, and it all
grew from there. I was even brought in to help rewrite parts of a script for
a movie featuring Diane Lane called Untraceable—about a serial killer
live-streaming deaths online—because of my knowledge of the digital field.
Eventually, I was ready to find a new Hook Point to launch me to
another stage of my career at Lakeshore. Two years later, I came up with an
idea for a type of advertising technology that stemmed from research I was
doing on Myspace. At the time, Fox News Corporation had acquired
Myspace for around $580 million, and I was trying to figure out how they
would effectively monetize it. In my research, I noticed that they had a
gold mine in front of them and were missing out on the most valuable
form of advertising. Myspace users were posting movie trailers, music vid-
eos, and posters of their favorite brands on their Myspace profiles. Peers
were sharing content with peers—word-of-mouth advertising at its finest,
and influencer marketing in its earliest form (before social influencers
existed). I believed that Myspace could monetize their network with the
inherent peer-to-peer advertising that was already taking place. At the time,
they were only getting bottom-basement cost per impression (CPM) rates
from banner ads—it wasn’t scaling or profitable, which was one of the
main issues with their business model.
The Hook Point I presented in lieu of this insight was wrapped around
the idea that people could make money off of this new digital behavior. In
the story I told, I pointed out that users were posting movie trailers and

Meet Hook Point, Your New Secret Weapon 15
brand posters on their Myspace profiles. I explained that this was the most
valuable form of advertising—a friend telling a friend, “Check out this
product or service”—and said that we should monetize it. Instead of get-
ting one-dollar CPMs (cost per thousand impressions), you could charge
companies one dollar per click (or possibly more). I shared the potential
about where social media advertising could go with this concept.
Looking back on it now, the technology could be likened to the first-
ever social media influencer advertising platform. Myspace users could
choose a movie trailer, commercial, or banner from our library related to
something that they were passionate about and put it on their Myspace
pages. Then, anytime other users engaged with these advertisements, users
who had it on their profiles would get paid. It was very similar to what an
influencer platform is today, but again, since this was around 2007, influ-
encers didn’t really exist yet. Without even knowing it, I was laying the
groundwork for what an influencer deal could look like, and for what social
influencers would ultimately become.
Initially, I brought the idea to the president of Lakeshore and another
business adviser. They both ended up investing in the technology. I built a
prototype of the platform, and once it was done, we started to take it
around and present it to different corporate partners.
During this time, I was forced to get really good at the process I share
with you in this book. When you’re just some kid at the beginning of his
career, trying to get big corporations or partners to pay attention to yet
another new start-up technology, you have to be articulate, different, and
most important, you have to stand out. You need to figure out how to cap-
ture attention, as well as build trust and credibility, or big companies
either won’t take meetings with you or they do but they don’t take you
seriously.

16 HOOK POINT
We ended up meeting with Viacom, MTV, Yahoo!, Paramount, MGM,
Fox, Myspace, and Facebook (back when it had fewer than 400 employ-
ees—so, yes, to this day I kick myself for not trying harder to land a deal
with them). Eventually, we landed a licensing deal with MTV. Through
this partnership, we created several iterations of the platform and had a lot
of success testing it with Rock Band, Vice magazine, MTV, Country Music
Television, VH1, and Viacom.
Not many people know that Vice magazine’s video arm started out as a
joint venture between MTV and Viacom. MTV invested a few million
dollars to get them up and running; then Vice bought them out a few years
later. Since they were partners during the time I was licensing technology
to MTV, I got to meet with Vice’s founder, Shane Smith, and their head of
creative, Eddy Moretti, who ended up licensing the technology as well.
Due to some complications—mainly the fact that it arrived too early to
the digital scene—the technology never ended up launching out of private
beta to the public. I don’t see this as a failure; I learned a lot in the process
and built solid relationships. And most important, for our purposes here,
the Hook Point and the story around the platform was compelling enough
to get people to buy in, and paved the way for the launch of my next Hook
Point and product.
Shortly thereafter, I started developing a website technology that could
dynamically write code, similar to the type of technology we now have
access to through companies such as Wix and Squarespace. I brought a
prototype of the platform to MTV and licensed it to them for another
sizable check.
The Hook Point that got them interested in this website technology was
developed from the fact that at the time, Viacom (the parent company of
MTV, VH1, Comedy Central, BET, and Nickelodeon) was helping a lot of

Meet Hook Point, Your New Secret Weapon 17
musicians and celebrities become big stars through MTV’s network. But
Viacom wasn’t directly profiting off of anyone’s leap to fame. My technol-
ogy was an opportunity to start developing business relationships with
some of these stars and celebrities. It was a tool that could help celebrities
ramp up their digital business, and in turn, MTV could take a piece of the
action.
Shortly after we closed the licensing deal, the lead executive asked me if
I wanted to meet with Taylor Swift about the product. At the time I didn’t
know who she was. She was on the rise but wasn’t the huge global superstar
she is today. I took the meeting, which was primarily with Scott Borchetta—
the founder of Big Machine Records (which was eventually sold to Scooter
Braun)—which is the record label Taylor was under back then.
When I met with Borchetta the first time, it was backstage at a Grammy
Awards rehearsal in LA. At some point Swift came into the room singing
loudly, and we talked briefly, but the meeting was focused on showing
Borchetta the value of the website technology for the growth of their digital
business. It went well. That meeting led to several meetings with Swift’s
father, then her mother, and then eventually with Taylor Swift.
In each meeting I had to understand how each of the individuals per-
ceived the situation. I had to listen to their concerns so that I could address
them with a variant of the Hook Point and value proposition that met their
needs and solved their specific pain points. Listening intently and crafting
stories to address concerns was the key to my success.
Borchetta and Swift’s father were concerned that they’d already spent six
figures on a flash website. They were frustrated by how much they’d
invested and that it had taken them two days to update any aspect of the
site. To address those concerns, the Hook Point and subsequent conversa-
tions were centered around how much money they could save and make

18 HOOK POINT
with our platform. Additionally, they were concerned about the current
home-page bounce rate of 90 percent, which was causing them to lose
e-commerce revenue from their merch store. I explained that with our
technology, we could optimize the site on the fly, drop down the bounce
rate, and keep people on the site for longer lengths of time. We could build
a brand-new website in hours that any member of their team could dynam-
ically change without having to know how to read and write code.
These Hook Points appealed to them, so I finally built up enough trust
to earn a meeting directly with Taylor Swift. By then I’d learned a lot about
what she wanted. From discussions with the various members of her team,
I was aware that she was very hands-on. She loved to go on her social pro-
files, customize them, and actively engage with fans; she was frustrated by
the fact that she couldn’t modify the website herself in the same way she
could modify her social media accounts.
When we met, I showed her the brand-new website that we’d built for
her with our technology in less than six hours. I walked her through how
she could change any aspect of it, in minutes, all by herself without modi-
fying any code. I even had her use the mouse to change the backdrop of the
entire site with different album artwork and showed her how she could
change around the navigation system without writing any code. She expe-
rienced firsthand the fact that this technology would allow her to quickly
express her creativity, which was what got her excited about it. After that
meeting, we closed Taylor Swift as our first major client for the platform.
Knowing which Hook Points to use with specific audiences, and how to
say it in a way that gets results, stemmed from the process you’ll learn in
this book. If you follow it, you’ll have more access to the types of big meet-
ings you’ve always dreamed about, and it will help you more effectively
market your products and services, both online and off.

A GOOD HOOK POINT CAN CHANGE THE WORLD . . .
Early on in my career, I learned that understanding the effective use of a
Hook Point was essential for marketing, branding, and positioning oneself
for success. But it wasn’t until I spoke with my copywriter friend Craig
Clemens that it dawned on me that a great Hook Point doesn’t just help
foster success, it can actually change the world.
While we discussed Hook Points and their possible impact, Clemens
shared that in the 1920s, there was a gentleman named Claude Hopkins—
one of the great advertising pioneers and fathers of modern-day marketing—
who created brands that are still around today, including Goodyear Tire
and Quaker Oats.
. . . FOR BETTER
One of the most famous stories about Hopkins relates to how he got mod-
ern society to brush its teeth. Back in the 1920s, there was a toothpaste
maker called Pepsodent. They approached Hopkins and asked him to help
them sell more toothpaste. Hopkins said, “Well, as you know, that’s kind
of a small market. . . .” This was because, back then, only 5 percent of peo-
ple brushed their teeth on a daily basis. It sounds pretty gross now, but our
current health standards didn’t exist. Apart from one or two days a week
when people took the time to brush their teeth, everyone was walking
around with very bad-smelling breath.

20 HOOK POINT
Hopkins realized that the best way to increase sales for Pepsodent tooth-
paste was to go after the 95 percent of the population that was rarely brush-
ing their teeth. He came up with a brilliant advertising campaign that
explained that using toothpaste to remove film from teeth would make
people look cleaner and better-looking.
The campaign featured pinup girls and men in the service—they were
like celebrities at the time—and were used as Hook Points to show that
good-looking people brushed their teeth so they could keep them super
white. The tagline for the product was: “Pepsodent Makes Teeth Far
Brighter,” and the magazine ad copy read: “FILM, a dangerous coating that
robs teeth of their whiteness. Here’s a way to remove it that quickly restores
brilliance.” The copy also explained that you needed to use Pepsodent every
day, twice a day, as an inexpensive and quick method to improve yourself
and look like a star—another strong hook for the product.
The campaign was a success. Soon, the 1957 jingle was everywhere:
“You wonder where the yellow went, when you brush with Pepsodent.”
26
Pepsodent suppliers couldn’t keep up with the demand. Not only did it
become one of the best-selling products of the decade, and the best-selling
toothpaste for more than 30 years, but it also changed the number of peo-
ple who brushed their teeth on a daily basis. Those who brushed their teeth
went from 5 percent of the population to 65 percent within ten years.
It’s fascinating how the right Hook Point can forever change the world.
In Clemens’s words, “If you’ve ever kissed someone with bad breath, then

you definitely understand how important Hook Points can be for the bet-

Hook Points can also be used to change the world for worse. . . .
Clemens shared that back in 1962, a gentleman named Edward Bernays
became the father of public relations and propaganda. He also happened to
be Sigmund Freud’s nephew. He studied Freud’s psychological theories,
such as crowd psychology and psychoanalysis, and applied them to con-
sumer public relations—a term he invented and wrote a book about in
1945. Bernays started the first-ever public relations company and became
an associate of very powerful people, including presidents and CEOs. With
all his knowledge and power, he did a lot of amazing things; unfortunately,
not all of them were good.
George Washington Hill, the president of the American Tobacco
Company, asked Bernays how they could get more women to smoke.
27
Bernays contacted psychoanalyst Abraham Brill, who disclosed that to a
feminist, a cigarette symbolized nonconformity, and freedom from male
oppression. This insight is what the Hook Point for his campaign was
founded upon.
Bernays decided to get media attention in a natural way that didn’t look
like advertising (an act that was revolutionary at the time). He chose to do
it at the biggest social event of the season—the New York City Easter Day
Parade of 1929. Various high-society people would have floats there,

including one with a group of debutantes, who were equivalent to the Paris
Hiltons and Kim Kardashians of our day.
Bernays contacted the press before the parade and told them that a group
of women’s-rights marchers would “light ‘Torches of Freedom’ at the
parade.” 
28 
He gave the debutantes and other women packs of Lucky Strike
cigarettes. They were instructed not to light them until they crossed the
street, where he had photographers eagerly waiting to take their pictures.
On April 1, 1929, the New York Times reported on the event and wrote:
“Group of Girls Puff at Cigarettes as a Gesture of ‘Freedom.’” 
29
The news about how these debutantes declared independence and
strength with their torches of freedom led to much higher rates of female
smoking. That year alone, the percentage of female smokers rose by 7 per-
cent,
30 
and it created lasting effects on the way people perceive women who
smoke. Even today, when people think about female smokers, they see
someone like supermodel Kate Moss—a leather jacket–wearing badass
chick who fires up. This long-lasting image is the product of a Hook Point.
Quick Tips and Recap
• A Hook Point can be composed of text (e.g., a phrase, title, or
a piece of copy), an insight (e.g., from statistics, a professional’s
point of view, a philosophy, or a person’s thought), a concept/
idea or format (e.g., an image or video), a personality, a

CHAPTER 2
TESLA, THE BLAIR WITCH,
AND YOUR GUIDE TO CREATING
A PERFECT HOOK POINT
When developing a Hook Point for a company, product, or piece of con-
tent, I typically base it on what I feel the audience may want or need. My
first thoughts are, How can I solve my audience’s specific pain point or prob-
lem? and What is an outcome my audience has been seeking that they’ve yet to
find? For example, a Hook Point I’ve used in the past to grab attention at
scale, “Zero to a Million Followers in 30 Days,” attracts people because
they’re seeking the outcome of building a large, effective social following,
but they don’t know how. By tapping into people’s desires to market them-
selves on social media, I get them to pay attention. Notice, however, that I
don’t say, “I’ll help you grow fast on social media” or “Let me teach you
how to grow fast on social media.” I simply make a bold statement: “Zero
to a Million Followers in 30 days.” (We will get into the specifics of crafting
a compelling Hook Point later on, but I want you to be aware of this dis-
tinction as you observe the Hook Points presented throughout this
chapter.)

26 HOOK POINT
Even the Hook Point I use for the subtitle of this book, “How to Stand
Out in a 3-Second World,” fulfills a pain point. Brands and individuals are
struggling to stand out among the competition and noise. They want to
create or find better jobs, secure more prestigious clients, drive revenue
growth, and close bigger deals. A large part of achieving these goals is sim-
ply getting someone to pay attention to you long enough to have the
opportunity to express the value of your product line, service, and/or
brand.
You want to appear unique, desirable, and different. Focusing on how
you can position your value proposition to inspire your potential audience
will help you go further, faster. Let’s look in depth at some examples of
people and companies who’ve developed great Hook Points.
ROPE-FREE SOLO
Free Solo, a film by documentary filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth
Chai Vasarhelyi, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in
2019. The Hook Point of this movie is the plot. It’s about a professional rock
climber named Alex Honnold who was the first person to climb El Capitan,
a 900-meter vertical rock face in Yosemite National Park without ropes. The
novelty of seeing the incredible feat of climbing a mountain that steep and
that high without ropes draws audiences in. I put “without ropes” in bold
because that is the hook—if Honnold had climbed El Capitan with ropes,
the Hook Point wouldn’t be as strong.
Proof of this point is that the same directors, Chin and Vasarhelyi,
had previously made a film called Meru about the first ascent, with
ropes, of the “Shark’s Fin” route on Meru Peak in the Indian Himalayas.
Meru has a good Hook Point in the trailer (you can watch it here:

Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 27
www.brendanjkane.com/meru), showing how the filmmakers thought
they were going to die while climbing Meru. It hooks you right away and
makes you wonder if the climbers will survive, but the movie didn’t achieve
the critical acclaim and box-office success of Free Solo.
I personally feel that Meru is the better movie (keeping in mind that I’m
someone who knows nothing about rock climbing), but the Hook Point in
Free Solo is stronger because it’s tied to the fight-or-flight response that it
produces in viewers when they see Honnold’s struggle to make it to the top
without a rope. (You can experience this by watching the Free Solo trailer
here: www.brendanjkane.com/free.) This trailer helps you realize that
Honnold could die at any moment during this climb—it puts you on the
edge of your seat as you watch, feeling as if you’re up that high with him,
without a rope. I want to be clear that I think Free Solo is a good movie,
but I believe it did well at the box office and won an Academy Award
because of its strong Hook Point. The Hook Point is what allowed the film
to break through to mainstream audiences that have no interest in rock
climbing.
Free Solo is a great example of how a product or an idea itself can be a
Hook Point. You don’t have to risk your life to have a good Hook Point,
but you do need something story-worthy or different. You need something
that can be packaged in a way that’s concise, catchy, impactful, interesting,
and true. You want to capture your audience’s attention and leave them
wanting more.

28 HOOK POINT
ONE FOR ONE®: WITH EVERY PRODUCT YOU PURCHASE,
TOMS WILL HELP A PERSON IN NEED
When Blake Mycoskie started Toms Shoes, his initial hook was “one for
one”—meaning that for every product consumers purchased, Toms would
help a child in need on their behalf. Mycoskie had a strong story to back
up his Hook Point. In 2006 he was visiting a small village in Argentina and
noticed that the children there didn’t have shoes. Wanting to help these
kids, Mycoskie developed the “one for one” concept, which became his
Hook Point and allowed the company to succeed and grow at a rapid rate.
In fact, by 2014, Bain Capital invested $313 million in Toms, which led to
its being valued at more than $600 million.
31
Unfortunately, over the last few years, the company’s growth has stalled
significantly—there were negative credit ratings and bankruptcy rumors. A
Moody’s report said net sales for 2018 were around $336 million.
32 
Former
Starbucks and T-Mobile executive Jim Alling, who has been with Toms
since 2015, admits that the brand struggled when they started to focus
more on design than their mission. He says, “You have to be great at foot-
wear, but what distinguishes us is our total story.”
33 
Also, the original hook
has been copied many times by other brands because of how much it
helped Toms stand out, receive funding, and grow at a rapid rate. In fact,
this copying of the model is a contributing factor to why the original hook

lost steam and why new hooks have needed to be introduced to keep the
company relevant and make it stand out among the competition.
Now, Toms is trying to tackle homelessness and support female empow-
erment and social entrepreneurship in the hopes of evolving into different
Hook Points and expanding the brand. Regardless, to date, Toms has
donated more than 35 million pairs of shoes to children and expanded the
model to include sunglasses and coffee. Through that effort, the brand has
given eyeglasses to 250,000 people in need, and clean water to five differ-
ent countries.
34
NO LATE FEES
As mentioned earlier, the initial Hook Point for Netflix was “No late fees.”
They knew that one of the frustrating aspects about renting movies from
Blockbuster (their biggest competition) was that you always had to go to
the store to rent and return movies. And if you returned a movie even one
day late, you were charged late fees. Apparently, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings
was not a fan.
One day Hastings checked out the movie Apollo 13 from Blockbuster,
lost the cassette for a few days, and was penalized with a late fee of $40.
After he left the store frustrated and embarrassed (a pain point almost every
Blockbuster customer could relate to—myself included), he drove to the
gym. On the way there, he started to think about a better system for movie
rentals. He wondered why it couldn’t be more like, well, joining a gym.
What if people paid a monthly fee and rented an unlimited number of

movies each month? Shortly thereafter, Netflix started mailing people
DVDs, three at a time, and the company was born.
35
Netflix has grown way beyond its initial beginnings (and into different
hooks), but the initial Hook Point, “No late fees,” is what attracted atten-
tion to a small start-up and paved the way for it to become the media giant
it is today. Over time, this Hook Point allowed Netflix to dominate the
market, kill off Blockbuster (who failed to come up with new Hook Points
to keep their market share), and become one of the most valuable media-
service providers in the world. Netflix generated $15.8 billion in revenue
in 2018 
36 
and had approximately 125 million customers 
37 
(not too shabby).
ELON MUSK’S UGLY CYBERTRUCK
Tesla’s Cybertruck doesn’t look anything like any other truck on the road
(or any other car, for that matter). Public opinion around the press launch
for the Cybertruck was very polarized, but one thing is for sure—this vehi-
cle quickly caught people’s attention. Pickup trucks have had the same
design for nearly a hundred years,
38 
and most truck owners are very loyal.
Tesla CEO and cofounder Elon Musk knew that if he wanted to make an

impact in this industry, he had to do something very different, which is
why he came up with a design that was unlike anything anyone had ever
seen (or imagined).
The Hook Point of the Cybertruck is effective not only because it catches
people’s attention, but also because there’s a method to its madness. The
new design gives the truck superior utility offered at an affordable price.
Marketing and brand strategist Mike Gastin calls the truck a “masterstroke”
of branding—it truly aligns with Tesla’s vision of “delivering the future,
today.” Time will tell if the Cybertruck outdoes Ford’s F150, but generat-
ing more than 250,000 pre-orders of the Cybertruck right after it was
announced is remarkable.

ZERO TO A MILLION FOLLOWERS IN 30 DAYS
“Zero to a Million Followers in 30 Days” is the main Hook Point I initially
used to scale my brand. What a lot of people don’t know is that building
this massive social following was for that exact purpose—to have a strong
Hook Point to leverage for larger opportunities that could help expand my
brand.
I set out to build a million followers in 30 days because I knew that the
Hook Point would capture attention so that I could provide value to others.
I was never trying to become an influencer or a celebrity—I just wanted to
entice people to listen to the larger story that I had to tell. And that’s why,
before I built my following, I approached a renowned literary agent, who

Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 31

32 HOOK POINT
currently represents me, and asked him if the topic of generating a million
followers in 30 days would appeal to publishers. I knew that there was a big
difference between proposing the book title Zero to a Million Followers in 30
Days versus something along the lines of How to Grow Followers on Social
Platforms. The former is specific and catchy, while the latter is general,
generic, and overused in a very crowded market. My knowledge about Hook
Points helped me secure that publishing deal and sell a lot of books, which
eventually led to the next deal for this book, and many other significant
business opportunities that have resulted in millions of dollars in revenue.
When choosing Hook Points, it’s important to keep specificity in mind.
You can’t tell a story that people have heard a hundred times or they’ll get
bored and become numb to it. The whole point of a Hook Point is to help
yourself stand out. Think about what makes you, your brand, or your
product unique—completely different from others in your field.
SUBVERTING EXPECTATIONS:
FLIPPING EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ON ITS HEAD
Many good Hook Points get people to think differently, which is why sub-
verting expectations with your Hook Points is a good tactic for capturing
people’s attention. One way to do so is to take commonly held beliefs or
phrases and flip them on their heads. For example, in a successful social
video, my team and I created the Hook Point “WARNING!! Safety is
Dangerous.” This challenged the commonly held belief that playing it safe
was a good approach to life—instead, it encouraged people to take risks
and fight for their dreams.
Your beliefs don’t necessarily have to be in agreement with the subverted
phrases you come up with. For example, in one video that I recorded for

my social accounts, I used the Hook Point “Meditation is a scam!” I’ve
been meditating for ten years and think that it can provide huge benefits
when done correctly. I use this hook to capture people’s attention so that I
can deliver the real message behind that hook, which is that because med-
itation is so popular, there’s a lot of misinformation about what it is and
how to do it properly. The goal isn’t to try and trick people, but to grab
their attention about a subject they may be interested in. By subverting
expectations, you can share valuable insights that people may otherwise
skip over if they aren’t attracted to your initial hook.
Naveen Gowda, digital content strategist on my team and former VP of
content at First Media, adds that the practice of subverting expectations is
all about getting your audience to look at an idea or concept through a
different lens or from a different angle. If you peer into a room from differ-
ent windows located on various walls of a house, your perspective of that
room will change. Subverting expectations with your Hook Points allows
you to do the same thing—you can give people a new perspective or out-
look on a familiar topic.
It’s an especially useful tool when you work in a crowded market. If
you’re a yoga teacher, meditation teacher, chef, or the like, you won’t stand
out if you repeat the same information that everyone else does. And, unfor-
tunately, this applies even when your underlying brand foundation or per-
spective is actually more useful than that of your competitors. That’s why
you need to switch up the conversation in a unique way. Otherwise, people
will find your content boring and/or won’t receive your messages, which
never caught their attention in the first place.
Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk (also known as Gary Vee) is an exam-
ple of someone who subverts expectations all the time. In one of his
social videos (which you can watch here: www.brendanjkane.com/gary), a
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 33

34 HOOK POINT
woman comes up to his car and says, “Give me three words that’ll give me
inspiration for any day I’m feeling down.” Gary Vee replies, “You’re gonna
die.” He is an entrepreneur, like millions of others like him, who inspires
people to hustle and work hard. This video is a perfect example of how he
completely subverted this woman’s expectations (and the viewers of the
video) with his answer to her question.
When most motivational entrepreneurs are asked a question like this,
they typically respond with common phrases such as “Work hard,” “You’ll
make it, “Use your head,” or “You’ll be successful.” Gary Vee’s choice to say
“You’re gonna die” completely goes against the grain and definitely cap-
tures people’s attention. Although Gowda thinks Gary Vee’s choice is bril-
liant in the example above, he also warns that there’s a delicate balance
between subverting expectations and becoming a contrarian, so be con-
scious of this fact when coming up with hooks.
Another good example of a brand that knows how to subvert expecta-
tions is digital media company Yes Theory. The brand is built around the
idea that “life can be as authentic and fulfilling as you wish if you seek
discomfort.” Their videos urge people to push themselves out of their com-
fort zones with hooks such as “Becoming Superman with the Ice Man,
Wim Hof,” “I Lived in a Luxury Airport for 4 Days. Nobody Noticed,”
“Asking Strangers to Go Skydiving on the Spot,” “Traveling to the Least
Visited Country in the World,” and “Letting a Coin Flip Control Our
Lives for 24hrs (Dubai).”
The idea of living outside of your comfort zone and pushing your
boundaries has been spoken about many times, but Yes Theory presents
the topic in a unique way by coming up with crazy adventures (that serve
as powerful hooks) around this theme. By wrapping their messages in this
format and context, they subvert expectations and grab more attention.

The video Becoming Superman with the Iceman, Wim Hof (which you can
watch here: www.brendanjkane.com/superman) is a stand-out example—
many other people have interviewed Wim Hoff (a Dutch extreme athlete
noted for his ability to withstand freezing temperatures), but Yes Theory’s
video captured more attention, receiving more than eight million views
with their strong hook for the interview.
HOOK POINTS DRAW PEOPLE INTO STORIES
Those of you who’ve read my book One Million Followers know that the
underlying principles I teach are actually about content testing and optimi-
zation. The book is about so much more than simply how to gain followers
quickly. If the book only covered one formula on how to hack follower
growth, it wouldn’t provide as much value to readers or help me become a
thought leader in the digital space. Nevertheless, the Hook Point “Zero to
a Million Followers in 30 Days” has gotten people to pay attention and has
helped transform my career.
After finishing the book, I hired someone to film a short interview about
the process and philosophy I used to generate a million followers in 30
days. Then, I used this video interview to create a few advertising cam-
paigns on Facebook and Instagram that drove viewers to an application to
work with me. As a result, I received 16,000 applications from people all
around the world. That’s how strong my Hook Point was—people wanted
to know more about the story behind how I did it and how they could do
it too. It tapped into a strong desire and need.
After that success, I leveraged the Hook Point and the book, not only
to generate new clients, but also for speaking opportunities through com-
panies and venues such as IKEA, Mindvalley, and Web Summit (which has

an audience of more than 70,000 people); major podcasts like Finding
Mastery: High Performance Psychology with Michael Gervais; TV and radio
appearances on Fox Business, SiriusXM, KTLA, and Yahoo! Finance; and
features in publications such as Forbes, Entrepreneur, and Inc. magazine,
which gave me even more clout and exposed my brand to additional
people.
The “Zero to a Million Followers in 30 Days” Hook Point allowed me
to capture the attention of millions in order to tell a story that people
needed to hear but may otherwise have skipped over or ignored. Also, the
story behind my Hook Point was authentic (the importance of which I’ll
cover in chapter 5), so it allowed me to grow my business and help others
worldwide achieve their goals.
The “Zero to a Million Followers in 30 Days” Hook Point wasn’t my
first hook and won’t be my last. I’ve been constantly testing Hook Points
over the course of my entire career. Whether it was while pitching one of
the various technology companies I launched, a campaign idea for a movie,
or an attempt to close a celebrity client, I’m always testing, learning, and
refining hooks for myself and my clients.
I didn’t become a true expert at developing Hook Points quickly and
efficiently, however, until I worked with renowned broadcast journalist
Katie Couric. That was when I started to test headlines, hooks, and con-
tent every single day for a year and a half. While working with her, I tested
75,000-plus variations of content (which I discuss in detail in the next
chapter). It was during this time that I developed an innovative process to
test headlines, topics, and themes at scale, and my Hook Point method
started to conceptualize as I collected data.

THE FOUR-HOUR WORKWEEK
Tim Ferriss’s book, The 4-Hour Workweek, is a great example of a solid
Hook Point with a strong value proposition. Readers are drawn to it
because most people would love to work fewer hours, spend more time
with their families and loved ones, travel, and enjoy their hobbies whenever
they wish. Ferriss’s Hook Point offers a solution to a common dilemma. If
you read his book, you’ll see that there are many strategies that go beyond
the concept of working fewer hours per week. But the hook is so effective
that Ferriss is constantly asked if he really only works four hours a week. He
has explained that this annoys him, because the question only comes from
those who didn’t read the book. Regardless, it’s the idea (and hook) of only
working four hours a week that allows Ferris to capture enough attention
to share the rest of his story.
Ferriss’s book is a bestseller because of this succinct, thought-provoking
message. I personally love the book, and the interesting thing is that the
concepts are nothing revolutionary—people have shared similar advice in
the past—but The 4-Hour Workweek stands out and has sparked more
interest than its competitors because the concepts are tied to a solid Hook
Point in the title.
Ferriss was well aware of the importance of his title hook. In fact, he tested
dozens of other titles in Google AdWords to find the best one. The 4-Hour
Workweek beat out This Sucks, How to Live Like a Druglord and The Wild
Gooserace
40 
(are you surprised?). The specificity of working only four hours a
week was catchy and fresh. It created a clear image of a lifestyle choice (that
didn’t involve drugs or geese).

38 HOOK POINT
Copywriter Craig Clemens adds that Hook Points can take an unoriginal
idea and get audiences to take it more seriously or find it more interesting.
It all depends on how you say it and the context in which you wrap your
message. You can get people to think you’re a genius by presenting a familiar
concept in an original way.
It’s not enough to simply talk about yourself and explain what you do.
Many others have the same skill sets. To stand out in three seconds or less,
you need to find what makes you and your product or information unique
and relevant to other people’s lives—that is, develop a succinct, atten-
tion-grabbing way to relay your information. People will stop and pay
attention if you associate yourself with timely, interesting topics that meet
your audience’s needs.
WHAT KEEPS YOUR AUDIENCE UP AT NIGHT?
As I mentioned earlier, Craig Clemens is the founder of Golden Hippo,
one of the largest direct consumer marketing and brand-building compa-
nies on the web, and has generated more than a billion dollars in sales.
There are very few people on the planet who’ve reached his level of success.
Clemens attributes this success to knowing how to craft Hook Points that
solve his audience’s pain points. With this knowledge, he grabs the atten-
tion of those who browse around on Facebook, The Huffington Post, or
TMZ—reading about the Kardashians or Donald Trump—and he changes
their focus. He gets them to pay attention to compelling Hook Points.
Eugene Schwartz, the legendary copywriter of the 1970s and ’80s,
advises entering the conversation that prospects have in their own minds.
Clemens feels that today it’s more important than ever to think about your
prospects and their internal thoughts. In this micro-attention age, your

Hook Point needs to tap into the problems that keep your audience up at
night. Perhaps your potential clients suffer from persistent stomach pains
and you have a vitamin that could ease the digestive process. Or maybe
they don’t have enough storage space on their computer and your company
has a solution. Whatever the product, you can use a Hook Point to show
that you can help solve an important problem in your audience’s life. Jump
into their minds as a guide, and teach them something new.
Marketer and psychological teacher Wyatt Woodsmall taught Clemens
that if you describe people’s problems better than they can, they’ll subcon-
sciously believe that you have the solution. So use your Hook Points to
show your prospects that you understand their issues. It may help them
gravitate toward your products, which will lead to purchases.
THE SLEEP DOCTOR
Michael Breus, PhD, is known as “The Sleep Doctor,” which serves as his
Hook Point. It has helped him secure appearances on programs such as The
Dr. Oz Show more than 35 times, and on the Today show multiple times.
So how did Breus find this powerful Hook Point? Well, very early on in his
career, he became board certified in clinical sleep disorders. And while
there are terms for different types of doctors, such as pulmonologist for a
lung doctor or otolaryngologist for an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, there
was no term for doctors who deal with everything related to sleep.
In an attempt to find an effective way to market himself, Breus read a
book by Peter Montoya and Tim Vandehey called The Brand Called You. It
explained that your brand name should consist of what you do in three to
five words. Breus started asking people what they thought his occupation
was, and their answers always revolved around medicine and sleep. From
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 39

40 HOOK POINT
there, he started looking at URL names and discovered that “sleep doctor”
and “the sleep doctor” were taken. He got ahold of the URL holder and
purchased them, which turned out to be one of the best expenditures he
ever made. Ever since, “The Sleep Doctor” has been a powerful Hook Point
for Breus’s business.
HOOK POINTS GENERATE STRONG RESPONSES
Immediately after choosing “The Sleep Doctor,” Breus developed strong,
positive recognition from his consumers . . . but backlash from people in
his field. Because he was calling himself “The Sleep Doctor,” his colleagues
thought he was implying that he was the best in the field, or the only one
who did this type of work, so there was a lot of jealousy. Breus was pushed
out of many professional circles and wasn’t invited to many conferences in
his area of expertise. It took somewhere between five and ten years before
people stopped calling him a “charlatan” and a “sellout.”
When Breus was invited to a scientific meeting as a panelist, some audi-
ence members would protest, “You have no credibility here. You’re an
internet doctor.” Ironically, by the end of the conference, those exact same
people would come up to him and ask, “Hey, how do you get so much
media attention?” In the public forum, he was an outcast, but behind the
scenes, everyone wanted his advice. His colleagues’ duplicity only gave him
the strength to stick with the use of his Hook Point. He knew that if they
wanted what he had, he wasn’t doing anything wrong. Breus stayed the
course because when it came down to the facts, no one could fault him for
the way he was using scientific research. “The Sleep Doctor” is one of the
best hooks I’ve ever heard, so I’m glad Breus persevered.

When creating a Hook Point, it’s positive if people have a strong
response, even if some of those responses are negative. People have called
Elon Musk’s new Cybertruck “ugly,” and yet it generated a lot of pre-orders.
Sometimes I even receive backlash for the “Zero to a Million Followers in
30 Days” Hook Point. People will comment on my Instagram posts, say-
ing, “One million followers means nothing if you have no engagement.” I
don’t feel offended when people write these kinds of things—if they actu-
ally read my book, they’d see that I agree with them. When people leave
these negative comments on my posts, they’re actually just helping me gain
more visibility. But don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that any press is
good press—if the response is overwhelmingly negative, you probably do
have a problem. My point is that some negative responses will come with
the positive—you’ll never receive 100 percent positive feedback for any-
thing you do—but as long as the positive outweighs the negative, you’re in
a good spot. You only need to change gears and head in a new direction if
you aren’t getting a response, or again, if the vast majority of responses is
negative.
HOOK POINTS HELP YOU PACKAGE INFORMATION
Using “The Sleep Doctor” as a hook makes Breus more accessible, and his
communication style matches this fact. He avoids big, scary terms when
speaking to audiences. He can have a discussion about neurochemistry but
doesn’t think it appeals to his consumers. In the 3-second world, audiences
want complicated information brought down into bite-size, actionable
chunks—Breus’s ability to do just that has led to his appearance on The Dr.
Oz Show more than 35 times. This fact has now become yet another Hook
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 41

42 HOOK POINT
Point. When people hear about a sleep doctor who’s appeared on Dr. Oz
that many times, their interest is sparked; they want to know how and why
this guy is getting so much media attention, and they immediately see him
as a more credible source.
And Breus’s Hook Points don’t stop there; he constantly packages the
information he discusses into hooks such as “The exhausted executive,”
“What’s the best mattress to sleep on?” or “When’s the best time for sex
before sleep?” All of these Hook Points get people to pay attention. They
are relatable and address an inherent interest in common problems.
Basically, they turn Breus into a walking Hook Point. He capitalizes off the
simplicity of messages that draw people in and plays off of their curiosity
and the need for credible solutions.
You can do this, too, by packaging your information in ways that help
you become more accessible. Break down your facts and test different
Hook Points. And then, who knows? Maybe I’ll be seeing you on TV some-
time soon.
FORTUNE 500 AND CELEBRITIES
When I meet people in person and they ask me what I do, sometimes
(again, I’m always testing), I’ll say, “I’m a digital and business strategist for
Fortune 500 companies, brands, and celebrities.” “Fortune 500” and
“celebrities” are the keywords that typically drive people’s intrigue and
interest. Overall, this hook is left a bit vague on purpose—because I’m
doing this in person—so I can measure the response in real time, listening
to the types of questions people ask, and observing the expressions on their
faces. Then, based on that feedback, I modify my responses with appropri-
ate stories and additional hooks.

When people ask, “Well, what does that mean? What do you do?” I say,
“I look at my clients’ short-term and long-term business objectives, and the
obstacles they’re running into, and I help them craft a strategy to reach
their goals in the shortest possible amount of time.” Then, again, I craft my
next responses based off of their responses. I’m looking for their pain points
so I can show them that what I do can provide them with the maximum
amount of value. I go over this process a bit more in depth in later chapters,
but for now, let’s go back to that initial Hook Point.
If my Hook Point was, “I’m a digital and business strategist,” it wouldn’t
be as strong. I anchor the fact that I’ve worked with Fortune 500 compa-
nies and celebrities to pique people’s interest and make them want to hear
more. I layer in the subjects “corporations, brands, and celebrities,” because
the people I’m speaking to may work for, or may be trying to become one
of, these three entities, and it shows them that I specialize in those areas.
Also, the Fortune 500 and celebrity aspects build validation, credibility,
and intrigue.
With all of that said, I don’t use this hook for public-facing content
that’s presented to the masses. If I rented billboard space or was given the
cover of a magazine to advertise my brand and services, I’d use the Hook
Points “Zero to a Million Followers in 30 Days” or “How to Stand Out in
a 3-Second World.”
THE IF/THEN FORMULA
Copywriter Craig Clemens explains that his Hook Point creation process
is different for each company and product because they’re all unique.
However, he shares a basic formula that you can use as a starting point to
discover yours. It’s a simple if/then formula: Point out your prospects’
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 43

44 HOOK POINT
problems or needs after the if, and use your product as the solution to their
problems after the then. For example, if you have a product that could help
improve a person’s dating life, you could use this formula: “If you’re look-
ing to increase the amount of dates you get with attractive, high-quality,
smart women/men who have it together, then this is going to be the most
important thing you’ll ever read.” Or, if you’re marketing to someone who
wants to become a better golfer, an example could be: “If you’re looking to
improve your golf game by five or ten strokes by the next time you set foot
on the golf course, then pay close attention to the four secrets I’m going to
share with you next.” Clemens suggests using the if/then formula as a starting
point, and then A/B testing the Hook Points you come up with against
other ideas that are a bit more off the wall (more on A/B testing at the end
of this chapter).
CREATE FOR YOUR AUDIENCE, NOT FOR YOURSELF
One of the biggest mistakes people make when coming up with Hook
Points—or any content, for that matter—is creating them for themselves
instead of for their audience. People tend to create content by thinking
about what makes them look good or what is trendy or cool in their indus-
try. But thinking about yourself and following the status quo won’t help
you stand out.
Clemens’s wife, Sarah Anne Stewart, works as a certified Integrative
Health Coach. She spends a lot of time focusing on nutrition, exercise,
mindfulness, and other health-related topics. She stands out by offering a
unique heart-centered approach in these areas. Although the people in her
circle do some really impactful and unique work, when you look at their
websites and Instagram accounts, a lot of their content looks the same. The

majority of these people post pretty pictures of themselves drinking green
juice, meditating, doing yoga poses over a skyline, or preparing recipes. The
imagery is beautiful, but when everyone is posting the same type of content,
it becomes less effective and intriguing. That’s not to say you shouldn’t pay
attention to successful formats and structures of content that others are
using. You should, but just make sure you understand the type of content
that’s working to create an engaged audience so you can make it your own.
Stewart, for example, focuses on giving her prospects health-related
advice so they can improve their lives. Recently, she posted a video about
the dangers of going on fad diets and offered tips about what people should
do instead. Also, she frequently posts information that teaches her audi-
ence actionable steps they can immediately take to improve their health.
She creates content that adds instant value to people’s lives.
If you find that the Hook Points you generate aren’t working, be sure
you’re approaching your marketing tactics from a consumer-focused angle,
especially if you’re trying to sell products. In this case, the if/then formula
where you point out your audience’s problem or need after the if and use
your product as the solution to their problem after the then (explained in
the section above) can be of great use. Thinking about your audience’s
desires will work much better than thinking about your hook from your
own point of view. If you’re working off the equation, “I want X, so I’m
going to try and get my consumers to do Y,” you’ll typically lose.
In the film industry, studios often make the mistake of putting out
advertising with messaging that says, “Buy tickets.” This does not motivate
potential moviegoers to pay attention. In fact, it does quite the opposite.
Movie studios are the ones that want people to buy tickets, but patrons just
want to watch great films, which is why ads with this type of messaging
often fall flat. Potential moviegoers don’t go to a theater because a studio
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 45

46 HOOK POINT
tells them to; they go because they’re intrigued by a concept, story, or expe-
rience that gets them to see a film based on their own desires. I know it
might sound like common sense, but you’d be surprised how often people
miss this fact. When studios take this into account and focus their market-
ing on the customers, they come up with better solutions.
The next time you go to a movie, listen to the comments from the peo-
ple around you after each trailer finishes. You’ll typically hear people say,
“That looks terrible” or “I definitely want to see that!” This is a fun exercise
that will help you learn which trailers have the best Hook Points and
stories.
Also, remember the adage “People love to buy, but hate to be sold to.”
When people get the sense that you’re trying to sell them something, it
turns them off—it’s not a strong Hook Point. Instead, be customer focused.
If you give customers what they want, this will fulfill their needs, which
ultimately will fulfill yours. If you’re sure that your Hook Point is con-
sumer focused and it’s still not working, you may need to simplify the
message or play around with the words. Test and learn until you find the
winning combination.

NEW BRANDS HAVE TO WORK HARDER
Latham Arneson, the former vice president of digital marketing at
Paramount Pictures, reminds us that unestablished brands have to work
harder than established brands to stand out and create compelling Hook

Points. Promoting a new Marvel movie isn’t the same as marketing an inde-
pendent film. A Marvel movie is part of an existing brand that’s clear in
people’s consciousness and high in their levels of interest. You must be
realistic about how important your brand or the topic of your content is in
people’s minds before you present it to them.
There are very few people and products that have an interest level so
high that they don’t have to work to get others to pay attention to them. If
consumers have no understanding of who you are or what you do, you
need to educate them. Be flexible and open to trying different formats to
discover the best ways to present your concepts. Test various Hook Points
to learn what works (a process that we’ll discuss later in this chapter).
PREDICTING THE FUTURE: HOW TO FIND THE NEW NEXT
In the film industry today, it’s become standard to do a five-second trailer
before the full trailer to capture an audience’s attention in the first three
seconds on social media. As effective as it may be now, it’s not going to
work in the same way after people have seen it hundreds of times. “Your
job as a marketer is to figure out what’s next,” explains Arneson. I discuss
the mini-trailer concept and how it’s a result of our 3-second world in the
next chapter because I think it’s useful to understand, but I agree with
Arneson’s point. When a strategy works, people start to copy it (as I
pointed out with Toms Shoes, earlier in the chapter), but as Arneson
notes, it’s smarter to be on the experimentation side, pushing forward,
rather than waiting to catch up. Stay culturally aware so you can get ahead
of the curve.
If you spend your time copying the exact Hook Points that everyone else
creates, you won’t stand out. You’ll simply end up doing what is considered

normal. Instead, push yourself to find ideas that are exceptional—that’s
where the magic lies for long-term brand awareness and growth.
THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT:
EVERYTHING YOU’VE HEARD IS TRUE
The movie The Blair Witch Project came up with a creative idea for its mar-
keting campaign, which created a lot of buzz and left people captivated
before the film was released. Artisan Entertainment, the studio that made
the film, marketed it as though it were a true story made from real-life
footage. Their taglines, which also served as their Hook Points, were: “In
October of 1994, three student film makers disappeared in the woods near
Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a 
documentary. . . . A year later
their footage was found”; “The scariest movie of all time is a true story”;
and “Everything you’ve heard is true.” Even the trailer made the movie look
like a documentary—the actors were speaking directly into the camera
while crying in the woods.
During the release of the movie in 1999 at the Sundance Film Festival,
Artisan Entertainment posted missing-persons posters of the three main
stars—Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard, and Heather Donohue—all
over town. None of the actors were famous at the time, so people started
wondering if this was actually a real documentary about three kids who
went missing in the woods.

The marketing team was also very tech savvy (for the time), and as a
result, The Blair Witch Project was one of the first movies to be marketed
primarily through the internet. Although the campaign was a huge success
back then, I’m not convinced that a similar ploy would work today. People
are now more sophisticated and aware, which is another reason why it’s
critically important to constantly test, learn, and innovate.
YOU CAN’T SKIP THIS GEICO AD
BECAUSE IT’S ALREADY OVER
The Martin Agency created an exceptional advertising campaign for Geico
Insurance in 2015. It was a skippable pre-roll ad (a promotional video
message that plays before the content a user has selected that a viewer can
skip but only after watching it for a minimum of five seconds 
42 
) on YouTube
called “Family: Unskippable.” This ad ended up being part of a campaign
that won Ad Age’s first-ever Campaign of the Year award.
43 
It made fun of
the fact that people often skip past pre-roll ads as soon as they can.
One of the ads from the campaign featured a family sitting at a dinner
table. The mother says, “Don’t thank me, thank the savings.” This dialogue
is finished after two seconds of the video starting. Then suddenly a voice-
over says, “You can’t skip this Geico ad because it’s already over.” That
dialogue is completed by the end of the five-second mark. Then, during

FIVE STEPS TO CREATING AN EFFECTIVE HOOK POINT
Below are some guidelines to help you understand the essence of a great
Hook Point. Of course, not all great Hook Points follow every single one
of these rules, but I’ve seen that most Hook Points include at least some, if
not all, of the aspects below. Use this as a guide, especially when you’re
creating Hook Points for the first time. Once you learn the system and
get good at it, you can start breaking the rules and create your own
guidelines.
A great Hook Point:
1. Uses as few words as possible (envision a magazine-cover head-
line)—that is, “Zero to a Million Followers in 30 Days.”
2. Remains true to who you are and why you exist as a brand. If it’s
unrelated, it will come across as clickbait and inauthentic.
3. Makes people think differently and subverts expectations. For
example, in a successful social video I created, the Hook Point
was “WARNING!! Safety is Dangerous.” This challenges the
44 
“GEICO TV Commercial, ‘Family Unskippable,’” iSpot.tv, 2016, https://www.ispot.tv
/ad/7ajB/geico-family-unskippable#.

commonly held belief that acting safely is a good approach
to life.
4. Doesn’t make people think very hard—it’s presented in a simple-
to-understand manner.
5. Doesn’t make people think too little—if someone doesn’t think
at all about your hook, then it’s probably being ignored.
6. Has an element of curiosity that leaves audiences wanting to
learn or view more—that is, “Elon Musk Made the Cybertruck
Ugly on Purpose—and It’s the Smartest Thing He’s Ever Done.”
45
This article’s Hook Point makes you want to understand why
creating an ugly car was a smart decision.
7. Stands out with originality. If you’ve seen your Hook Point used
somewhere else, it probably won’t work.
8. Combines a common/relatable element with something that is
unique, and that draws your audience in. An example is the
Away Travel suitcase with phone-charging capabilities. Suitcases
have been around for decades, but a suitcase that can charge
your phone is a novel idea.
9. Can be grasped quickly. Make sure your Hook Point can be
understood in three seconds max.
10. Offers a solution to your audience’s pain points. Legendary
copywriter Eugene Schwartz used pain points in his headlines all
the time. For example, “Begin your middle years at 70, 80, even
90!” which addresses the pain point of aging, or “How to Stroke

52 HOOK POINT
Wrinkles Right Out of Your Face,” which again addresses another
pain point related to beauty and aging.
46
When developing a great Hook Point:
1. Expect it to be a process. You won’t typically find the perfect
Hook Point on the first attempt (or even the first few attempts).
2. Create more ideas and variations than you think possible. If you
can, create 50 to 100 potential concepts. Doing so pushes your
creative limits and helps you come up with better ideas in the
long term.
3. Rework ideas—reword them, reshape them, turn them upside
down, and mix variations together.
4. Remember that a Hook Point doesn’t have to sell your product
or service. It just needs to get your customers and/or prospective
customers to take notice of you. Once you have their attention,
you can begin the conversation about the sale of your product or
service.
5. Make it for your audience. Figure out what will grab their
interest.
6. Don’t force it to be funny. Make sure you’re confident in your
ability to create effective Hook Points before tackling humor, or
hire a great comedic talent to help you.
7. Be aware that a Hook Point doesn’t have to be words; it can be a
concept. For example, YouTube channel “Ten Second Songs”
46 
“Eugene Schwartz Headline Formula,” YouTube video, posted by Copy Skillz, Aug. 4,
2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvqtqQUa6Qo&feature=youtu.be.

creator Anthony Vincent takes famous songs and breaks them
up into different music styles every ten seconds. In this video, he
takes Katy Perry’s song “Dark Horse” and changes the style of
the song so it sounds like bands such as The Doors, John Mayer,
Queen, and so on. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.
com/watch?v=jus7S5vBJyU.
8. Be cognizant of the fact that a Hook Point is often different
from a tagline or a USP. “Just Do It” is Nike’s tagline, and their
USP is their shoes. Today, their strongest Hook Points, which
are found in their different campaigns, are the athletes they
sponsor (as explained in chapter 1).
9. Don’t confuse a Hook Point with branding. A Hook Point acti-
vates a brand by getting people to pay attention to their prod-
ucts, services, and values. Again, Nike demonstrates this concept.
The fact that Nike is an athletic fashion brand is not the hook—
the uniquely differentiated products they put out (such as the
running shoe that’s going to be banned from the Olympics
because it’s so effective) or the celebrities they sponsor are what
grab people’s attention.
10. Know that scarcity and exclusivity can be great tools. The fact
that a private, members-only club like Soho House is exclusive
makes it more desirable.
11. Know that your Hook Point can be in a content format. In the
next chapter we discuss Buzzfeed’s video cooking channel, Tasty,
and how the format in which they present their content is their
Hook Point.
12. Remember, above all else, that it needs to grab people’s
attention.
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 53

54 HOOK POINT
Now it’s time for you to practice the art of creating Hook Points. To do so,
follow the “Five Steps to Creating an Effective Hook Point” process below.
Step 1: Study What Works
Look for effective Hook Points used by successful brands, and put them in
a list. You may be tempted to skip this step, but don’t. Even copywriter
Craig Clemens, whose words have sold over one billion dollars’ worth of
products, used this method when he first started creating headlines and
Hook Points because his original hooks were horrible. Looking at other
brands’ Hook Points helps you refine your craft.
Hooks can be pulled from:
• Book titles
• Social content:
° Meme cards (text caption boxes that appear at the top or
bottom of a video on Facebook or Instagram—they’re
explained more in depth in the next chapter)
° Headlines
° Concepts
• Launch campaigns
• Article headlines
• TV commercials
• Social media ads (use the Facebook Ad Library to search for ads
here: https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/)
• Print ads (billboards, magazine covers)
Now, take the best Hook Points from the list you’ve just created and replace
their offers, words, businesses, or services with your own. Pay attention to

how these hooks (which are modeled after other brands’ hooks) help you
stand out. Keep in mind, however, that you can’t use these hooks for your
brand (unless you substantially change them). The purpose of this exercise
is not to steal (or replicate) other brands’ hooks, but to practice and spark
ideas for new, original Hook Points.
Step 2: Learn from What Doesn’t Work
Research underperforming Hook Points and diagnose why you think they
don’t work. To do so, you can go to social channels, search for videos, and
look at the ones that aren’t performing well. You can also go on Amazon,
Google Shopping, and Yelp, type the name of a product or service, and
observe which listings come up that have the fewest number of reviews or
the most negative reviews in a certain category. You can also search for
companies, products, and services that have failed, underperformed, or
closed down, and find the ads that they were using when they went under.
Additionally, you can go to a magazine stand and see which magazine or
book titles don’t capture your attention immediately. Finally, study bill-
boards, and analyze the ones that don’t intrigue you and that don’t stop you
in your tracks.
Hooks are generally ineffective because they’re:
1. Too wordy
2. Confusing
3. Vague
4. Overused: hooks that have been copied thousands of times by
other individuals or companies
5. Not relevant to a specific audience
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 55

56 HOOK POINT
6. Outdated—not relevant to today’s society/culture
7. Created with the assumption that people are already interested
in a particular topic
8. Inauthentic
9. Not unique enough
10. Unappealing, or use language that doesn’t catch the eye
Step 3: Create Your Own
Now it’s your turn to practice creating your own original Hook Points.
Imagine that you’ve been given the cover feature article in a major maga-
zine or newspaper. The goal is that once it’s gone to print, it sells a massive
amount of copies and generates a significant number of customers for your
business. To achieve this, put yourself in your customers’ shoes.

Imagine a woman, a potential consumer, walking down a busy street.
Cars are honking, attractive people are walking by, others are shouting, and
your prospect is getting bumped into left and right. Now she’s passing a
magazine stand with 30 other magazines and newspapers that could grab
her attention first.
In this scenario, which headline/Hook Point could you create to grab
your prospect’s attention enough to make her stop, actually buy the maga-
zine or newspaper with your headline (as opposed to the other 30 maga-
zines sitting right next to it), and read your article?
You can get some inspiration by going to an actual magazine stand or by
searching for previous covers of a magazine in your niche online. Intently
study the magazines or newspapers you’d like to be featured on. Whether
it’s Vogue, Sports Illustrated, or Entrepreneur, take the time to notice the
headlines. Which ones are compelling to you? Which ones don’t stand
out and make you want to dive in and read the article? What makes
you pick up (or not pick up) the magazine or newspaper and read it? Think
in those terms to help you find the most effective Hook Points for
your brand.
You can do this exercise with a digital ad or a piece of content in mind
as well. Imagine a man scrolling on his Instagram, YouTube, or Facebook
feed—what’s the headline or opening of a video that’s going to capture his
attention and make him stop for three or more seconds?
To test this out, you can even do a Photoshop mock-up of the Instagram
Explore page (a page composed of posts from people your potential cus-
tomer has followed, posts from accounts similar to the ones they follow,
and posts with high engagement). If you think your audience spends more
time on YouTube, you can also create a mock-up of the “Suggested Videos”
Tesla, the Blair Witch . . . 57

58 HOOK POINT
section. This section comprises the videos that YouTube suggests you watch
after a video is complete.
Once you’ve created the mock-up, insert your thumbnails, titles, and
headlines to see which ones stand out and grab people’s attention, and
which ones get lost in the fray. Again, choose a combination that can com-
pete with the dozens of other options. Your Hook Point needs to capture
people’s attention enough to make them want to click on your content to
see more, rather than others’.
In this exercise, create as many Hook Points as possible. Begin with a
large list and pare it down. You’ll often start with things that are in your
comfort zone, but continue to push yourself beyond that, as this is often
where the best Hook Points develop. Come up with as many ideas—
especially those that are outside the box—as you can. Remember, just
because you write it down doesn’t mean you have to use it, so let yourself
feel free to jot down all your ideas. Think big; think different.
Once you’ve completed your list, narrow it down to the three best
choices. Then, repeat the process—that is, create, narrow down to three,
and repeat.
Step 4: Compare Your Hook Points
Take the original Hook Points you’ve just created and compare them to the
successful hooks from Step 1. To do so, create a combined list with all these
Hook Points on the same page.
Now, rank the top Hook Points from this master list. You can also ask
friends, family, and other people on your team to select the ones they like
best. If your original Hook Points from Step 3 are not at the top of this new
combined list and beating out the ones from Step 1, then it’s time to revise

your hooks until they outrank the most successful ones you’ve found from
other brands. This process will help you push yourself to become the best
Hook Point creator possible. It may take some time to become an expert,
but the investment will pay dividends when you beat out the competition.
Remember, more than 60,000,000,000 messages are sent out online
each day. Your Hook Point must get past this noise.
Step 5: Test, Reiterate, and Repeat
After you’ve come up with Hook Point options that you feel pass the test,
show them to your friends and colleagues to discover which ones attract
the most attention. You can also A/B test your Hook Points on social
media, with your email list, and on search-engine advertising platforms.
Don’t worry if you don’t have immediate success—this process may take
time. The most important thing is that you continue to modify, repeat,
and improve your Hook Points so that you can find the most compelling
ones for your brand or business.
A/B TEST YOUR HOOK POINTS
Craig Clemens says that no matter how experienced you are at creating
strong marketing content, you’ll still come up with a lot of Hook Point
ideas that fail miserably. Furthermore, some of the concepts that are home
runs are the ones you never would have expected. This is why it’s essential
to continually A/B test your ideas. A/B testing is the process of comparing
two versions (or more) of something (e.g., a headline, a web page, an email,
social content, or other marketing asset) and measuring the difference in
performance between them.

Even when you find iterations that work, I suggest continuing to test
and learn. You can find a lot of information about how to do this in my
book One Million Followers (www.onemillionfollowers.com), and in a step-
by-step guide on how to A/B test headlines and Hook Points at this URL:
www.brendanjkane.com/test).
If you find Hook Points that perform well, you’ll want to start investing
advertising and media dollars in them so that your current and potential
customers can see them. Eventually, you’ll reach a point of dilution with
your Hook Points. This will require you to continue to create new Hook
Points, and test and refine them. Hence, the purpose of this book and the
exercises above is to make you an expert in developing Hook Points consis-
tently so that you can sustain long-term growth for your brand.
Quick Tips and Recap
1. When creating Hook Points, think about what makes you and
your product or information unique and relevant to other
people’s lives: What pain points are being solved? What is the
ultimate outcome your product or service is providing in some-
one’s life?
2. Subverting expectations with your Hook Points is a good tactic
for capturing people’s attention. Take commonly held beliefs or
phrases and flip them on their heads.
3. People will stop and pay attention if you associate your brand
with timely, interesting topics that meet your audience’s needs.
4. Think about your prospects and the conversations they may
be having in their own minds—tap into the issues that keep

them up at night. Provide solutions to the problems they’re try-
ing to fix.
5. Find ways to package your information that makes you more
accessible. Break down your information into bite-size chunks,
and test it out in the form of Hook Points.
6. Figure out the new next. Be culturally aware, follow the latest
trends, and try to stay ahead of them.
7. Refer to the “Five Steps to Creating an Effective Hook Point” in
this chapter to help you create Hook Points.
8. Remember that if your audience has to think too hard or too
little about your Hook Point, it’s not a good choice. Make sure
your concept doesn’t take more than three seconds to grasp.
9. When creating Hook Points, start with a broad list and pare it
down to the three best choices. Then repeat the process—that is,
create, narrow down to three, and repeat.
10. Get Hook Point inspiration by going to a magazine stand or
bookstore, looking on social media, or checking out other places
with lots of hooks to study.
11. It’s essential to continually test your Hook Points. It will help
you get more clear about which ones are the absolute strongest.
You can A/B test to your email list, on social media, or on
search-engine advertising platforms.

CHAPTER 3
60,000,000,000
MESSAGES A DAY: HOW TO FIGHT
YOUR WAY THROUGH THE NOISE
Now that you understand the principles behind what makes Hook Points
strong, let’s look specifically at how to apply their power to the creation of
digital content and videos. With more than 60,000,000,000 messages sent
out on digital platforms each day, Hook Points are essential tools that help
you stand out among the noise; and you can use them to more effectively
package content for a better chance at having meaningful engagement, a
strong viral presence, and growth.
In this section, I will also introduce you to the importance of images and
visual storytelling tactics that capture and hold attention. Visual storytell-
ing is vital—59 percent of senior executives would rather watch a video
than read text if they have the option. It’s a new phenomenon called the
“picture superiority effect,” where information presented with visuals is
learned and remembered more easily than information without. Including

64 HOOK POINT
an image in your social media posts delivers 180 percent more engagement
and increases content retention up to 65 percent.

USE HOOK POINTS TO PACKAGE YOUR INFORMATION
Back when I was working with journalist Katie Couric, we interviewed
some of world’s biggest celebrities, including Jessica Chastain, Joe Biden,
Chance the Rapper, and DJ Khaled, among many others. By testing all this
content, I discovered that the popularity of the celebrity at the time had
little correlation to how well the content performed. The simple fact that
someone is famous doesn’t provide enough incentive to get people to stop
and pay attention to content in today’s world. What truly captures atten-
tion is the way information is packaged, presented, and communicated on
digital platforms. The topic the celebrity discussed, and the way the topic
was presented to the audience, was often more responsible for the content’s
success than the fact that a celebrity was featured. In other words, leverag-
ing fame wasn’t enough; celebrities needed to be discussing topics that had
a strong hook to get audiences to stop scrolling through their feed, watch,
and engage.
We set out to innovate the standard interview for digital platforms so we
could help Couric’s content stand out among the noise. When we first
started working together, she had just made the jump from TV to a digital-
first distribution partnership with Yahoo!, and the algorithms were not

favoring her content. In other words, her content was getting suppressed
and wasn’t being shown to her fans or the fans of the celebrities she was
interviewing. To fix this, we had to completely change the way we pro-
duced, edited, and distributed her content across social media. So, instead
of starting with what questions she would ask in an interview, we focused
on what the final output of the interview would look like. More specifi-
cally, what were the potential Hook Points we could generate from the
interview that would grab audience’s attention at scale? We designed hooks
for each interview based on its appeal to different audiences we felt would
not only have an interest in the interview but also share it with everyone
they knew.
When Couric first brought me into meetings with Yahoo!, the execu-
tives told me that her content had a very narrow audience. I understood
that they wanted to hit that specific demographic to stay relevant and
deliver for their current advertisers, but I also knew that if we were going
to achieve scale and gain favor with the algorithms, we needed to extend
the appeal of her content beyond that audience and do it fast.
I knew that the best strategy to achieve this was to identify core advo-
cates for each interview based on the person we were interviewing and/or
the topic being covered. To accomplish this, we would develop different
hooks for each interview, designed to statistically increase the chances of
getting these core advocates to share the interview with everyone they
knew. The idea was that if we could get more people sharing each inter-
view, it would trigger the algorithms to give the content more reach and
increase the overall viral potential. In doing so, we were scaling Yahoo!’s
advertiser target audience and opening up Couric’s and Yahoo!’s brand to
new audiences at the same time. Effectively, we were getting friends to

66 HOOK POINT
share with friends, sons and daughters to share with their parents, and sib-
lings to share with siblings. By leveraging Hook Points, we engineered hit-
ting any audience we desired at scale.
The first interview Couric and I tested together was with actress Elizabeth
Banks. The interview was structured with three major Hook Points in
mind. Again, we started with the Hook Points rather than the questions
Couric would ask. Since Banks was in the movie franchises The Hunger
Games and Pitch Perfect and was a strong feminist advocate, we designed
Hook Points that would resonate with each of these audiences.
As mentioned above, we made all our decisions with the final output in
mind—which Hook Points about The Hunger Games, Pitch Perfect, or fem-
inism could make people stop scrolling through their feeds and pay atten-
tion to what Couric and Banks were discussing? How would they be
packaged to stop the never-ending scrolling? The fact that Banks spoke
about popular subjects wasn’t enough. The way the interview was packaged
needed to have many unique hooks—something the audience didn’t know
and hadn’t seen before.
When we were coming up with Hook Points, I used the magazine exercise
(Step 3, shared at the end of the last chapter). I thought, If Hunger Games
fans were walking down the street, which headline would capture their attention
enough to make them stop and check out the article? The headline/hook that
performed the best out of the content we created from the Banks interview
was: “How I got a role in The Hunger Games.” This hook appealed not only
to fans of the movie, but also to those who aspired to be actors or were simply
curious about what it takes to get a role in a major film. It’s important to note
that we created 30-plus Hook Points for this interview alone and tested hun-
dreds of different variations of these hooks to find the winning variation.

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 67
Developing a high-performing Hook Point is not about guessing and
putting all your eggs in one basket; it’s about testing, iterating, and testing
some more until you find the right answer that drives results.
(To learn more about the A/B testing process I used for all of the inter-
views I worked on with Couric, check out my first book, One Million
Followers, and the step-by-step A/B testing guide here: www.brendanjkane
.com/test.)
Although the Banks interview received a lot of engagement and views,
the top-performing interview Couric and I worked on together was with
Brandon Stanton, the founder of the photoblog “Humans of New York.”
The top clip from that interview generated more than 20 million views and
was shared over 240,000 times. The headline we used was: “Creator of
Humans of New York joined Yahoo News Global Anchor Katie Couric
today to discuss his open letter addressed to Donald J. Trump on Facebook.”
The video touches on very political and emotional topics, and whether
people are in support of President Trump or not, they often have strong
opinions about him.
With this specific video, the Hook Point didn’t come from the headline,
but from Stanton’s opening remarks: “I’ve watched you retweet racist
images. . . .” And it wasn’t just his words, but the intensity with which he
delivered them, that drew people in—they wanted to hear what he would
say next. The timing of the video also helped. It was released during the
height of the 2016 election, when many people were on edge and feeling
very emotional. Many Hillary Clinton supporters shared this interview
with just about everyone they knew. This is a perfect example to demon-
strate that success is not just tied to celebrity. We interviewed celebrities
with 100 times the fame of Stanton, yet this interview outperformed them

68 HOOK POINT
all because of the subject matter, the packaging of the clip, the pacing,
Stanton’s personality, and a polarizing hook.
MY VIDEO WENT VIRAL. HERE’S WHY.
Derek Muller, creator of the YouTube channel “Veritasium,” which has
nearly six million subscribers, made a video called My Video Went Viral.
Here’s Why. The video explains YouTube’s algorithms and the importance of
having a Hook Point to draw people to your content. (To watch the full
video, you can check out: hookpoint.com/veritasium.)
In the early days of YouTube, subscriptions were king, meaning that if
people subscribed to a channel, YouTube would show them that channel’s
content when they arrived on the site. This kept things fairly simple for
creators—those who had a lot of subscribers had high amounts of watch
time on their channels. But now that we live in a 3-second world,
YouTube has had to adapt. To keep people on their platform, as opposed
to Facebook, Instagram, and so on, they had to change their algorithms.
YouTube quickly discovered that typically headlines with great Hook
Points were capturing a significant amount of watch time, and that getting
people to watch content was like selling newspapers on the street (I told
you so!).
Muller worries that the algorithms push people to create sensational
news items. He thinks they encourage the practice of yellow journalism—
the sharing of news with little or no legitimate research—which uses
eye-catching headlines for increased sales. He believes that social platforms
can only serve up truthful stories when the algorithms favor channel sub-
scriptions. That way, creators don’t have to use tricks to help them fight for
people’s attention.

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 69
Nevertheless, YouTube, and the majority of other social platforms, cater to
the 3-second world. YouTube has reduced the importance of subscribers and
has increased the importance of what Muller describes “clickbaity thumb-
nails.” I don’t recommend being inauthentic or using clickbait. Besides, it
isn’t as effective as it used to be because the algorithms have caught on to
clickbait. Currently, algorithms don’t solely favor clicks, but also watch time
and retention (discussed further below). I mention the importance of creat-
ing authentic Hook Points and stories more in depth in chapter 5, but for
now, keep in mind that catchy headlines (not clickbaity headlines) are
important, especially when it comes to being successful on YouTube.
Muller goes on to explain that one of his most viral videos, with more
than 32 million views, was created with this headline theory in mind. He
was in New York at the Creator Summit showing MrBeast (a YouTuber
with more than 34.4 million subscribers) some video footage about the
black plastic balls that were on the LA Reservoir to protect water quality.
MrBeast knew that the footage would be popular, so the two discussed
which headlines and thumbnails would provide the greatest hook. Muller
was thinking about calling the video Throwing Shade Balls, but MrBeast
steered him away from that title. Instead, he suggested Why Are There 96
Million Black Balls on This Lake? Muller changed the word Lake to Reservoir
(because that’s what it is), but the point is that Muller believes that the
popularity of the video is highly linked to the hooky title and thumbnail.
It created intrigue and sparked people’s curiosity.
Muller explains that going viral and getting tens of millions of views on
YouTube is dependent upon two metrics:
1. Watch time. You perform well in YouTube’s algorithm when
someone watches seven to eight minutes of your video. To reach

70 HOOK POINT
this amount of watch time, your videos should be no less than
15 minutes.
2. A high click-through rate. This is where Hook Points become
especially important. A high click-through rate is composed of
the total number of clicks on your titles and thumbnails, divided
by the number of times the titles and thumbnails have been
shown.
MrBeast told Muller that as you approach a 10-, 20-, or 30-plus percent
click-through rate, the number of views and impressions your video will
receive jumps up dramatically. In fact, it’s such a dramatic increase that it
turns YouTube into a site where the titles and thumbnails (which serve as
the Hook Points for videos) have an overwhelming importance.
“You can have a great video, but unless you have a great hook to get
people in, it’s not going to go viral,” states Muller. So, there you have it—
proof that this book is genius! Just kidding (sort of ). In all seriousness,
though, Hook Points matter. YouTube may adapt and change again, but it
doesn’t take away from the fact that as these platforms become more inun-
dated with content, standing out is critical.
Muller goes on to explain how you can use thumbnails to stand out.
They are some of the first visual elements of Hook Points. To find the
most optimal thumbnail choice, many YouTubers will Photoshop various
options into a screenshot of their current YouTube home page. They exper-
iment with various thumbnails in different positions to see which ones are
the most eye-catching. Top performers on YouTube test various thumb-
nails because they know that effective ones can help them stand out and
receive more views.

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 71
This is going to be even more important in the near future, because
YouTube is adapting the platform to show click-through rates in real time.
Muller hypothesizes that this change will lead to the practice of launching
videos and then immediately testing variants of thumbnails in real time to
achieve the highest click-through rates. In fact, Muller thinks that if cre-
ators don’t do this, they’ll be left behind, and their videos won’t be seen.
Video topics, titles, and thumbnails need to hook viewers if they don’t
want their content to be buried and lost. He says, “The truth is, the audi-
ence only knows you’re there if they see your titles and thumbnails.”
There is limited real estate in which to show people videos of interest.
All social channels need to use their real estate, aka their feeds, to show
people the videos they want to see. Audiences on YouTube communicate
what they like through actions such as watch time and clicks. And although
algorithms are always shifting, for now, YouTube is optimizing for long-
term watch time. So, use the power of Hook Points and good storytelling
techniques that you learn in this book to satisfy audiences and beat algo-
rithms on all social channels.
ALGORITHMS
Let’s briefly discuss algorithms. People get very frustrated when algorithms
don’t work in their favor, but they’re designed to do one thing really well:
make sure people keep coming back to a social platform. Imagine if you
opened up Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube and the content that loaded
on your screen was boring, uninteresting, and unamusing. What would
you do? You would close the application and move on to something else.
And if this kept happening every time you opened up the app, you would

72 HOOK POINT
slowly change your behavior and start allocating time to another platform.
To avoid losing users’ attention, algorithms are designed to find content
that will engage unique users each time they come to the platform. With so
much content being uploaded every second, and with most users following
hundreds, if not thousands, of accounts, the algorithms have to decide
which content rises to the top of the feed and which content gets stuck at
the bottom.
When you see accounts with huge followings but low engagement, it’s
typically not because the audience isn’t engaged or because they have fake
followers. It’s usually because the algorithms have deemed that there is
more engaging content on the platform and is prioritizing that content to
the followers of the account. When this happens, they don’t get high
engagement because most of their followers don’t even see their content.
Let’s say you have an account with 100,000 followers, and each time you
post a piece of content, the algorithm will send it out to 500 of those fol-
lowers and measure core metrics (for example, views-to-reach ratio, share-
to-views ratio, engagement to reach ratio, etc.). If the ratio and engagement
match up with what the algorithm is looking for, it will extend the reach of
that piece of content to 500 more people. If the ratios are good again, then
another 1,000 people will see it, then another 2,000, and so forth. The
algorithm will keep pushing your content further beyond your audience if
it’s deemed effective. On the other hand, if the ratios are not good, when
your content is sent to the first 500 followers, your reach stops right there—
the algorithm sees that the content is not resonating with the people to
whom it was released. And to make matters worse, if you keep putting out
content that doesn’t engage your audience, your account as a whole gets
recognized as ineffective, and your reach is very limited from the onset each

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 73
time you post. Essentially, the algorithm will stop giving your account a
chance.
That’s why it’s important to continually push out content that is designed
not only to engage audiences but also that matches what the algorithms are
searching for. When the algorithms recognize that you’re an effective con-
tent creator, you get more reach each time you post. It sets you up to expe-
rience dramatic growth like content creators Jay Shetty or Prince Ea, who
get massive reach and scale and generate billions of views each time they
share a piece of content.

THE 3-SECOND RULE
When I was a kid, we often talked about the “3-Second Rule.” It meant
that if you dropped a piece of food on the floor, you had three seconds to
pick it up and eat it before it was considered contaminated. Well, now the
same principle applies to social media video consumption. Within three
seconds, viewers have determined if they’ll continue to watch or scroll past
a video in their social channel’s feed (and oftentimes they’ve already decided
within one second).
Where does the 3-second rule come from? As pointed out in the intro-
duction, video product team manager Matt Pakes explains that three sec-
onds is the metric Facebook uses to register video views in the news feed.
He says, “If you have stayed on a video for at least three seconds, it signals
to us that you are not simply scrolling through the feed, and you’ve shown
intent to watch that video.”

74 HOOK POINT
The more people you can get to watch the first three seconds of your
video, the better. It raises your chance for a high number of views, and for
a longer length of view time. In turn, the algorithms will work in your
favor and push your content to more people.
Capturing attention within one second to generate the 3-second view is
difficult, as it’s a short amount of time. That’s why having a solid Hook
Point for your content is so essential. Let’s explore how you can use your
knowledge about Hook Points to structure your videos to significantly
increase the number of views.
GIVE THE GAG AWAY
As I mentioned earlier, Erick Brownstein is the president and chief strategy
officer of Shareability (and has created digital content for Cristiano
Ronaldo, the Olympics, Adobe, AT&T, and many other major corpora-
tions and celebrities). He explains that linear storytelling doesn’t apply to
social videos—it doesn’t help you capture attention within the first three
seconds. Instead, he advises social-content creators to consider giving away
the gags at the beginning of their videos. Shareability’s videos will often
give away the punch line or the emotional reveal within the first ten sec-
onds. They do so because it gives the videos a better chance of being more
engaging and even going viral. When coupled with more obvious visual
storytelling tactics—including optimizing content for mobile phones,
using close-up images, and shooting with proper lighting—putting the
most interesting or emotional parts of your content in the beginning helps
you capture attention quickly.

HOW TO DESIGN THE PERFECT PROMISE
Naveen Gowda, whom I mentioned earlier is the digital content strategist
on my team and former VP of content at First Media, brought First Media’s
social media content’s performance up to nearly three billion views a month.
The social channels he managed catered to millennial women and mothers
with content in the do-it-yourself (DIY) crafts and life hack–related spaces
on Blossom: https://www.facebook.com/FirstMediaBlossom/; content re-
lated to food on So Yummy: https://www.facebook.com/firstmediasoyummy/;
and content related to beauty on Blusher: https://www.facebook.com/
firstmediablusher/. Typical content concepts included videos that taught
viewers how to make picture frames out of baby-food jars, unique and
interesting recipes, or special ways to clean and repurpose everyday house-
hold items.
When Gowda started at BabyFirst (a brand within First Media), the
content was barely achieving 1,000 likes a post. He was frustrated because
he noticed that other publishers in the digital space were getting millions
of views on a regular basis. He set out to discover their secrets.
He started by analyzing the high-performing content of his competitors
from a communication and design perspective. Gowda studied successful
channels such as Tasty, a social channel created by BuzzFeed that shares
videos related to cooking, recipes, and food. He deconstructed how Tasty
approached content creation and replicated it through the lens of the
BabyFirst brand. He chose Tasty as his model because it was revolutionary
in the food space. In 2016, they had 3.7 million subscribers and more
than 190 million video views in less than a month.

most-viewed YouTube video is I Made a Giant 30-Pound Burger, with more
than 33 million views. (You can watch that video here: www.brendanjkane
.com/tasty, or at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4L2E6_Gmkk.)
Gowda’s most important finding was that the first three seconds of dig-
ital videos should be used to make a promise to their viewers—a promise
as to what the content is about and how the message will be delivered. You
don’t have time to communicate your entire brand’s concept or summarize
it within three seconds—viewers are barely getting prepared for what you’re
about to say. A better way to use this time is to set expectations for how
your message will be delivered. Is it going to be clear and engaging, or
messy and difficult to follow? You want your viewers to enjoy watching the
first three seconds so they give you more of their time.
In fact, every time you put out a video on social media, or anywhere for
that matter, it would be helpful to imagine that you’re applying for a posi-
tion in your viewer’s world. The job is your audience’s time, and you’re
applying for some of this precious resource. Viewers can be doing a myriad
of other things, so unless you present your case in a way that appeals to
what they need in this moment, you aren’t going to get the job.
Viewers and the algorithms will trust you if you have a strong method of
delivery. If you lose your audience’s trust from the get-go, your video won’t
be shared widely, which is what makes those first three seconds so critically
important.
THE EFFECT IS THE HERO
When approaching video creation and communication design for social
platforms, the effect you have on viewers is the hero. Some of the most
desired effects include getting people to have gut reactions that make them

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 77
feel, “Oh my gosh, that was so smart,” “Wow, I can really relate to that,” or
“This is really satisfying to watch.” You want your audience to have gut
reactions to your content rather than thoughts or a desire to analyze the
video from a logical point of view. Virality stems from your viewers receiv-
ing feelings of value, not from thoughts about you, your products, or your
ideals.
Once you know the gut reaction you want to produce in your viewers,
be sure all of your other decisions related to messaging, visual style, pacing,
actors, music, and so on, support that choice. For example, luxury brand
Gucci is an expert at getting people to feel a certain way about their prod-
ucts. They create entire marketing campaigns to make you feel that if you
wear their products, you’ll have status, power, sophistication, and desirabil-
ity. All of their messaging supports the effect they choose for the season. As
soon as you walk into their retail locations, you’re presented with a very
different experience from that of a traditional retail store with stacks of
folded shirts and a sales rack. Gucci promises to offer you luxury and exclu-
sivity, which you feel as soon as you arrive or even pass by one of their store
windows. The understanding of how to produce an effect is why Gucci can
get away with selling a T-shirt for $450 that most likely only costs them
$20 to produce. Well-designed content does the same thing—it offers
$450 of value, while other content on that medium (Facebook, Instagram,
YouTube) only provides $20 of value or less.
Choose your Hook Point knowing the effect you want to have on your
viewers. For example, In-N-Out Burger is more successful than many of
their competitors because they know the effect they want to have on their
customers. Their hook is not the fact that they’re a burger place, but that
when you leave their restaurant, you’ll feel satisfied and think about them
the next time you’re hungry. Gowda believes that all of In-N-Out’s choices

78 HOOK POINT
support this effect, including having a limited number of options on the
menu. That way you don’t get distracted or overwhelmed, and simply focus
on the quality of their food. Reducing and simplifying is hard work, but it
ensures a controlled consumer experience—consumers end up getting
exactly what In-N-Out wants them to, and they can focus their efforts into
making those specific elements excellent so that they can stay true to their
tagline: “Quality you can taste.”
Each time you create a piece of content, ask yourself, “What effect will
this will have on my viewer?” and “What do I want the effect to be?” Once
you’ve answered those questions, do research to determine if other content
creators have set a precedent—that is, they already reach your audience
successfully. Become a student of the vertical in which you want to create
content. Otherwise, six months down the line, you may realize that you
could have saved a ton of time and money by learning from other people’s
successes and failures.
Creating Hook Points—and the first three seconds of videos—with
your desired goal in mind will help you design more effective content.
Draw your audience in to your content so they want to watch it in its
entirety, and so the algorithms keep showing your content to new, poten-
tial viewers.

HOW TO NOT BE BORING:
COMMUNICATING AT THE RIGHT PACE
Deliver your value at a quick and satisfying pace, rather than a slow and
methodical one. Naveen Gowda reminds us that you have three seconds to
present the structure and establish a promise about the effect the video will
have on the viewer. Don’t go slow, but also don’t jump into things too
quickly or rush. Instead, use the first three seconds to establish the scene.
Create some kind of action or an unresolved situation. Then, when the
three seconds are up, you can begin to act on the idea you want to
present.
A lot of people try to communicate too much information too quickly,
leaving viewers in a position where they fall behind. Once viewers fall
behind, they start to feel like they need to play catch-up—it’s as though
they’ve come into a movie theater 20 minutes after the film has already
started—which is a very unsatisfying feeling. If people feel lost, they won’t
want to finish watching the rest of the video. Additionally, videos that
share too much information at once give viewers the feeling that every-
thing has been smooshed together, which makes them lose interest.
Gowda adds that your videos don’t necessarily have to be exciting, but
they do need to be easy to follow and fun. It’s not about incorporating
spectacle, but about keeping the video engaging all the way through.
“Boring” or unengaging sections of videos hurt video performance more
than people think. Be honest with yourself about how captivating your
content is, and think creatively about how to deliver segments that are not
as engaging (and also decide if they’re truly even necessary).
When creating DIY videos, where you walk viewers through the process
of creating or learning how to do a task or an activity, Gowda found that a
good way to set up the pacing in the first three seconds is to start with a

80 HOOK POINT
static scene where the camera doesn’t move or change angles. Then, an item
is introduced to the scene and something happens to it. For example,
Gowda’s team created a video that began with a red plastic cup. The first
three seconds were:
1. A red cup is introduced.
2. The cup is being crushed in the hand that holds it.
3. The smashed cup is put down.
After this intro, the actual content of the video starts. It may seem very
primitive and simple, but the simplicity made it easy to follow and drew
people in. Viewers stopped scrolling through the feed and watched the
next ten seconds of the video. In fact, the video gained more than 2.2 mil-
lion views: https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155697878679586.
Make sure people can follow the steps or the information in the video you
produce in the same way a person would speak about it. Gowda says the
visuals should follow the rhythm of “First do this, then this, and then that.”
This easy-to-understand format sets the stage. It makes audiences believe, I’m
going to be able to follow this. It starts the chain of thinking, Okay, what’s next?
Also, he adds that this linear form of communication doesn’t solely apply to
instructional videos—in fact, all videos should be structured linearly.
An example of a video that has good pacing and that shows how individ-
ual brands can deliver their first three seconds, is If It Doesn’t Hurt, It
Doesn’t Count, which you can watch on my Instagram account here: www
.brendanjkane.com/count. The first three seconds are effective because the
video gives the viewer time to read the burned-in headline, also known as
a meme card (which serves as the Hook Point) before the subtitles and

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 81
voiceover start. Also, the visuals progress slowly enough so that you don’t
need to focus on them while you absorb the headline and voiceover.
The video’s structure is set up to take viewers through the following
process: First, read the headline; then, glance at the visuals and understand
the context I’m offering. Now, listen to what I have to say. The later
dynamic of cutting to footage of me speaking from the initial visuals gives
the viewer the expectation that this isn’t going to be a series of bland found
footage, but rather, thought-out, conversational communication with the
viewers. The footage of me conversing is a nonverbal storytelling cue that
helps viewers follow me seamlessly.
SET THE STAGE WITH SATISFACTION
As a general rule, you don’t want to start too much action until after the
three seconds are up. Until that point your goal is to set the stage and spark
interest. However, although the story doesn’t need to develop just yet, you
do need to show viewers that the video has good pacing and that it won’t
be slow, boring, and static.
In the first three seconds, you also need to communicate that the visual
experience of the video will be satisfying to watch. This concept can’t always
be defined in logical terms. One way to think about it is through rhythm.
The rhythm of the visuals in the first three seconds should feel satisfying
and hold your audience’s attention. It’s very similar to how you feel when
you hear the first few seconds of a great dance song in a club. If it can get
you moving, you’re excited about hearing the rest.
This doesn’t mean your videos need high production value or that some-
thing impressive needs to happen. You could open your video with a bowl

82 HOOK POINT
and then pour a can of Coke into it in an interesting way. One may assume
that watching that would be boring, but that’s too logical of an analysis.
Sequences like this work because they’re visually appealing. It’s the type of
sequence Gowda has used to generate billions of views online.
DON’T MAKE YOUR AUDIENCE THINK
Don’t make your audience think during the first three seconds. In fact,
don’t try to force them to think too much throughout most of the video. If
you ask viewers to think, it needs to be impactful. That said, contrary to
traditional clickbait and headline theology, this effect is not always designed
in terms of shock or surprise. Sometimes you can create just as much of an
impact and genuine interest in a video through satisfying pacing and good
composition. Then, once you’ve established the right overall feel, finding
places to drop in more technical, heady, or thought-provoking messages
becomes easier and more palatable to your viewers. Gowda adds that estab-
lishing the right overall feel helps you avoid becoming the super-intelligent
yet boring professor who drops fact after fact for two hours, versus the one
who ties in stories and practical applications to make you feel excited to
learn more about the technical elements behind those applications.
How to Get Satisfaction in Three Seconds
The first three seconds of an effective social video are:
1. Satisfying to watch. They hook the audience and convince them
to invest their time in watching the rest of your content.

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 83
2. Moving at the right pace. Viewers need to know they can follow
the video.
3. Linear in delivery (that is, don’t make viewers work for you).
Gowda cites three examples of videos with great composition so you can

WHY MOVIE TRAILERS START WITH
FIVE-SECOND ADS FOR THEMSELVES
“Jason Bourne takes off his jacket, punches a man unconscious, looks for-
lornly off camera, and then a title card appears.” This is the first five-second
teaser for the Jason Bourne trailer that immediately follows. Teasers before
trailers have become the norm. The trailers for The Two Popes, The Irishman,
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Hobbs and Shaw are also structured
in the same way. These micro-teaser openings act as Hook Points in an
attempt to buy viewers’ time to watch the full trailer.
Teasers within trailers exist for the sole purpose of capturing viewers’
attention within the first three seconds. One of the trailers for Independence
Day: Resurgence starts with loud and spectacular images that don’t explain

84 HOOK POINT
what’s going on, but they stand out and spark intrigue. The actual trailer
takes the time to explain what’s happening in the footage that was shown
during the first three to five seconds. Movie studios have started doing this
because these trailers are shared on social media, giving marketers only a
few seconds to convince viewers to stop scrolling and pay attention.
Latham Arneson, the former vice president of digital marketing at
Paramount Pictures, believes that there are good and bad ways to execute
the design of these trailers. He warns that just because the images are loud
and bright doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll capture the audience’s attention.
The images need some level of intrigue. Get the audience to ask them-
selves, “Oh, what’s this?” Elicit their desire to see more. If people are inun-
dated with bright and loud images over and over again, those tactics will
become ineffective. “Pay attention to what’s out there so you’re not copying
everyone else,” advises Arneson. Find new ways to create a high level of
intrigue.
What’s interesting is that even movie studios that invest millions of dol-
lars, into a single piece of content have to work hard to find tactics to
capture people’s attention. The fact that they need to create a trailer before
a trailer is a reflection of the heavy level of competition that exists to get
views on social media.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SLEEP?
Arneson worked on the marketing campaign for the movie Paranormal
Activity, which had two really strong tag lines/Hook Points. They were:
“What Happens When You Sleep?” and “Don’t See It Alone.” The visual
hook of the trailer was that you were watching people’s fearful reactions to
the movie while watching it in a theater. The trailer barely shows any of the

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 85
movie; the images mostly show the audience reacting in fear, shock, and
surprise. Choosing to structure the trailer like this made viewers wonder
what could be scary enough to get people that freaked out.
The trailer was structured in this way because Paranormal Activity was a
low-budget film that built slowly; the movie wasn’t intriguing in a
short-content format. In fact, Arneson feels that if the trailer had simply
shown clips of the film, it would have been boring. It wasn’t a high-budget,
catchy-at-first-glance or visually impressive action movie. It didn’t have a
budget like Avengers or Star Wars, so it wouldn’t make sense to compete
with trailers for films in that league. By filming the people watching the
movie in a theater instead (showing them scared out of their minds), it
created a situation where viewers of the trailer were excited because they
wanted to experience similar reactions.
In summary, be conscious of what your product’s strengths are, and pres-
ent your content in a way that highlights those features. There are an
infinite number of forms in which you can package your content. Use trial
and error to find the methods that make the most sense for your product
or brand.
200,000 INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS IN A MONTH
I’ve spent a great deal of time developing strategies to grow quickly on
Instagram. The fastest way I’ve found to grow, with an increase of
about 150,000 to 300,000 new followers in a single month, is to test
and distribute content on other accounts with large followings. This is
the strategy I used to help me gain one million followers on Instagram
and several million followers for other clients and partners.

86 HOOK POINT
The types of accounts where I’ve had the most success distributing
content are memes. A meme account is one that isn’t an individual
person, influencer, brand, or corporation, but rather an account
focused on a specific niche. There are meme accounts for almost every
major niche: inspiration, fashion, food, sports, comedy, and so on. A
more formal definition of the term meme is “something such as a
video, picture, or phrase that a lot of people send to each other on the
internet.” Some popular examples of meme accounts include @the-
goodquote, @noteforself, and @thefatjewish.
Meme-account creators have to be amazing content aggregators to
capture the attention of millions of viewers and followers. One
method my team leveraged to grow quickly on Instagram was posting
my content on meme-account pages to drive people back to my
accounts. There are two ways you can achieve this:
1. Organically, by structuring a share for share (meaning
that meme-account creators will share your content if
you share theirs), or some other form of distribution
partnership where they’re willing to post your content
for free. This typically only works if your content is
highly engaging or you’re providing some other form
of value to the account and its owner.
2. You can achieve this placement by buying what is
called a shout-out, which is another term for buying an
advertising placement on someone else’s account. (For
more information on how advertising on meme
accounts works, check out my Rapid Audience Growth
Course: https://www.rapidaudiencegrowth.com/.)

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 87
When you buy a shout-out with a meme account, you want to
provide content that creates interest in your account. Essentially,
you’re creating an advertisement for your account with a strong hook.
Often, it’s in the form of a photo, along with messaging that inspires
others to follow you.
To be successful, you have to figure out the type of content and
hook that drives people to follow your account. That sounds simple,
but it’s really not. It’s of the utmost importance to create a strong
Hook Point, because otherwise, this process doesn’t work. For exam-
ple, one of our meme-distribution partners has more than 19 million
followers. When we’ve posted content with an ineffective hook on
their account, it can result in fewer than 200 followers, while a shout-
out with a strong hook could result in gaining 5,000 to 20,000 fol-
lowers in a 24-hour period. In both scenarios, the content is posted to
the same account and is exposed to the exact same audience, but the
content that has the more effective Hook Point grabs people’s atten-
tion and generates enough motivation for viewers to want to learn
more about the account promoted and to ultimately click on the
“Follow” button.
About 99 percent of the people reading this book need to package
their content with extreme creativity and effective Hook Points—I
personally practice this with my brand and clients every day. To stand
out in a 3-second world, think about the reactions you want people
to have when viewing your content. Clearly define and test what will
motivate them to go and follow your account. Like Hook Points, it’s
important to note that what works is constantly changing and evolv-
ing. The examples above may have evolved into a different format
because the old one stopped working.

88 HOOK POINT
MEME CARDS: WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW TO USE THEM
By testing hundreds of thousands of variations of content over the past few
years, I’ve learned that setting a clear and unique expectation about the
information you’re about to deliver (which can be expressed through a
headline, meme card, or burned-in captions) is incredibly important in
getting people to watch, click, buy, and/or share your videos.
A meme card, which is a text caption box that appears at the top or bot-
tom of a video on Facebook or Instagram, can help you communicate your
Hook Points quickly and clearly to those scrolling on social media. If you
use social media, you’ve probably seen a meme card. It looks like this:

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 89
Gowda explains that meme cards are an important structure in
Instagram’s and Facebook’s language—if you don’t integrate them into
your communication style, you’ll probably have a harder time attracting
attention on the platform. This is because meme cards set the expectation
for communication delivery and act as initial impressions or introductions
to your viewers. When you walk up to a checkout register and the person
behind the counter doesn’t smile, or is rude right off the bat, it sets the
expectation that you’re going to have an unpleasant interaction; whereas if
the person is friendly, smiling, and patient, before saying anything else this
individual has set the expectation that you’re going to enjoy the interac-
tion. Meme cards also help you set expectations—they help you make
the promise that you’ll deliver your interaction (aka content) in a cer-
tain way.
Gowda explains that oftentimes people create vague meme cards with
phrases like, “You have to watch this till the end.” A meme card providing
this little value is basically telling its viewers that they have to work extra
hard for the creator, as opposed to receiving something intriguing and clear
from that creator.
Recently, copywriter Craig Clemens posted a video with a meme card
that reads: “Impress her by eating healthy.” This sentence is the beginning
of a story about how he impressed his wife by eating healthy and then goes
on to talk about the importance of a nutritious diet. By delivering the
Hook Point through the meme card, Clemens gives his viewers enough
value to know that their time won’t be wasted by watching, and that they
won’t be forced to do any extra thinking—they can consume the content
passively. Eventually, he can translate that attention into action, but not
right off the bat. This is because you can’t ask your viewers to do something
for you in each piece of content you produce. Viewers have tons of other

90 HOOK POINT
options and will choose to watch other videos that provide them with more
value without asking them to work hard for it.
An effective Hook Point for a meme card creates intrigue. Gowda clari-
fies that the intrigue doesn’t have to act as an all-encompassing summary of
the story in the post; you can start out with a very controversial or outland-
ish statement while the story you tell is completely motivational or inspira-
tional—as long as the communication is authentic. This means: don’t
create meme cards that are clickbait, and make sure the phrase you choose
makes sense and is in line with the overall content of the post.
An example of a post that does this effectively is this clip of Adam Roa
giving a motivational speech on Mindvalley’s Instagram account. (You can
view the video here: www.brendanjkane.com/roa.) The burned-in caption
(which acts as the meme card in this case) starts with a statement that’s a
little bit shocking: “Buy this car, you’ll get girls. Buy this bra, you’ll get
guys.” Then Roa tells a story that promotes the opposite of that Hook
Point. The story is motivational and explains why you shouldn’t listen to a
consumerist society that tries to make you feel like you need material goods
to attract mates. Mindvalley chose those shocking sentences as the opening
Hook Point because they attract attention and because the true intent
behind the statement can be understood by viewers once they watch the
rest of the story. It’s not simply a shocking clickbait headline—it has a pur-
pose that’s backed up by the story.
Mindvalley only started using Hook Points in their videos recently. By
using Hook Points in the form of meme cards, Mindvalley’s video perfor-
mance has tripled. Their top-performing videos were receiving around
20,000 or 30,000 views before the use of Hook Points, and now they’re
able to reach 100,000-plus views on Instagram for most videos. In fact,
some of their top performers on Facebook are generating millions of views.

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 91
By front-loading the videos with this packaging and communication
design, the promise they make is clear, and viewers are responding by giv-
ing them more of their time and attention.

viral formats we use with our private clients, we have a detailed report

TESTING MEME CARDS
To help you find the best phrases for your meme cards, Gowda recom-
mends testing multiple versions. Remember, your meme card needs to sup-
port your message, not necessarily reiterate it. If the messaging or the video
is covering a complex topic, use a meme card to give your concept a base-
line or a floor on which to ground itself. Only when the visual action starts
at a slower pace can you use a more complex and punchy meme-card
phrase.
For example, the meme card “Laugh at yourself, or other people will”
(www.brendanjkane.com/laugh) features a phrase that’s a pretty big
thought—it’s a lot to process—which is why we chose to match it with
uncomplicated visuals of a lady sliding down a snowy hill. This keeps the
visual development minimal during the first three seconds, which gives
viewers time to process the meme card. Gowda notes that if you try to
communicate a complex thought in the meme card and show complex
visuals at the same time, this tends to overwhelm viewers. Keep that in
mind, and be sure to establish a nice balance between the text and visuals
in your communication design.
You can discover the right balance for your communication design by
testing granularly. Gowda and I A/B test different meme cards and

92 HOOK POINT
3-second intros to find the right balance. Perhaps option A will delay the
start of the voiceover by half a second, so that we know, by viewers’
responses, exactly where to edit the video to balance perfectly with the
meme card. And in subsequent options, we may test different text head-
lines in the meme card and/or open the first three seconds with different
found-footage clips. As you can see, there are many nuanced details that go
into generating highly viral social clips. We’ve spent years testing and refin-
ing this process. With that said, here are a few simple tips to start you on
the path of testing and learning:
Three Tips for Creating Effective Meme Cards
1. Do a competitive analysis. Look at your competitors’ successful
videos and see what kinds of meme cards they use. Put your
ideas next to theirs, and make sure yours stand out. (Refer to the
Hook Point exercise from the end of chapter 1.)
2. Provide value. It’s easy to create meme cards with text along the
lines of “Watch this till the end,” “This will inspire you,” or “You
won’t believe what happens next,” but those phrases don’t pro-
vide value. Audiences generally tune out these vague messages.
Instead, try to incorporate a tangible element of value in your
meme cards.
3. Be mindful of your typography design. Identify the key phrase
or keywords within the sentence or phrase in your meme card. If
possible, highlight them, and separate your phrase or sentence
where you want to break the line. You’ll see this in the meme
card for “Laugh at yourself, or other people will.” (You can view
this video again at: www.brendanjkane.com/laugh.)

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 93
You’ll see that my team brought
out “Laugh at yourself ” as a key part
of that sentence. We chose to distin-
guish one line from the other. Also,
notice that we put the first line in
bold. By doing so, we’re subcon-
sciously communicating how to
read this sentence, which helps
make it easier for viewers to digest.
We could have chosen to bold
“Laugh” as the keyword, but in this
case, it would have been a mistake
because it’s not enough of a com-
plete thought. Gowda recommends
providing tangible value right away,
whenever possible. On its own,
“Laugh” doesn’t tell the audience
anything—it’s just a word—whereas “Laugh at yourself ” is a complete
thought that provides value.
(We break down our typography-design principles for meme cards in
our viral video and framework report, which is available here: www
.brendanjkane.com/viralreport.)
USE SOCIAL ANALYTICS AND SEARCH TO TEST
AND FIND HOOK POINTS
While working at Paramount Pictures, Arneson tested his Hook Points
with social analytics. Whenever his team released a piece of content, they

94 HOOK POINT
would get tens of thousands, or sometimes even hundreds of thousands, of
comments on social channels. From this data they could evaluate how peo-
ple perceived the messages they sent out. They would learn which themes
and ideas people most cared about and responded to.
For example, when Arneson’s team released horror films, they knew they
were on track if people commented, “I’m scared out of my mind!” That
was an obvious signal that the content or trailer was working. There were
moments during the Paranormal Activity campaign when people would
comment that the commercials were keeping them up at night. This is the
exact effect his team wanted—they wanted viewers to be so scared that
they couldn’t sleep. The conversations Arneson’s team saw on social media
were some of the biggest markers of success.
Gowda cautions, however, to be wary about how you listen to com-
ments from your audience. Generally, he feels that analytics such as views,
retention, or shares trump comments. He agrees that you can get cues from
comments and need to be aware of the effect your videos are having on
viewers, but it’s dangerous to listen to comments too literally. Doing so can
stifle growth or lead you in the wrong direction. Instead, look at people’s
reactions in terms of scale and ratios rather than one-off pieces of advice.
Read the analytics and make inferences before you look at comments, to
help you judge them more astutely. Use comments to support your analyt-
ics, not as a guide on their own.
For example, if your analytics are showing that the content is strong, and
perhaps you’re getting an incredibly high ratio of shares to views, you can
look at the comments with the knowledge that the campaign worked. That
way, if a commenter criticizes the video, it won’t affect your future deci-
sions. Instead, you’ll know to pay attention to the positive comments to

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 95
glean additional, perhaps nuanced, insights about why the content is per-
forming well. Look at the data before you heavily weigh the comments
from your audience.
SEARCH DATA
Another indicator of success for Arneson’s team was search volume within
Google and other search engines. When the first Cloverfield movie trailer
was released, the film didn’t have a title. Paramount decided to use the
release date at the end of the trailer in lieu of the title. Arneson ran the
search department at Paramount, and he could see that after they released
the trailer, there were search spikes on the internet for the release date of
the movie. This showed that the intrigue for understanding what the movie
was about was very strong. Therefore, his team put more money behind
promoting the film to build off of that momentum and capture even more
attention.
You, too, can use search data to help you identify effective angles for
Hook Points in marketing campaigns. Gowda agrees that more people
should be aware of the power of studying and searching across various plat-
forms. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, and Google each have their
own algorithms that function distinctly to find the most effective content.
Use that to your advantage, but be aware of the pitfalls. One such pitfall is
that the algorithms can make content creators and social media managers
lazy—they let the algorithm do all the work for them, which limits their
analysis to only the highest-performing content from the most well-known
content creators in their vertical. Gowda warns that you need to look
broader than solely at the content that exists in your space. In most cases,

96 HOOK POINT
it’s hard to come up with great ideas when you limit yourself. His secret is
to find ideas from content across various platforms and from content that
doesn’t necessarily perform well (explained below).
Reddit
For Gowda, Reddit is one of the best platforms where you can find new
ideas. He feels that Reddit gets a lot of the best content first because their
algorithm has a lot less weight—content is pushed to the top from user
engagements. This is because Reddit is an active-engagement platform—
meaning that users aren’t just shown content to swipe through; they actu-
ally have to click on posts, which forces them to work to curate content on
their own. The platform trains viewers to be super intelligent in terms of
how they respond to content, so when a GIF, video, or concept actually
makes it to the top of the feed, it’s much more powerful than when it does
so on other platforms. Reddit is a place where the best content (regardless
of the prestige of its creator) can be discovered.
You can usually find a subreddit (a specific online community, and the
posts associated with it) for most broad categories. Gowda says that it’s
tricky to be super specific in your search, so he recommends subscribing to
subreddits and getting suggested posts related to broad topics in your space.
He also recommends using Google to search for topics with the word
Reddit after your search query because Google’s search tool is more effective
than Reddit’s. Then, once you find your subreddits, look through all the
content and find what makes you say, “Wow that’s cool.” That’s a founda-
tion for building Hook Points and stories.

60,000,000,000 Messages a Day 97
Tubular Labs
Gowda also recommends doing searches on Tubular Labs, which is an
advanced tracking tool that tracks all video content on YouTube, Instagram,
and Facebook. It lets you sort and search by views, shares, and likes, and
allows you to export data organized by various metrics. It’s a good way to
find top-performing videos and content creators. Gowda pays the most
attention to views within a certain time period or the ratio of shares to
views. He does caution, however, that you have to be discerning about how
you read the data. Sometimes paid media can spike a post’s performance,
and you don’t want to walk away thinking that the video was a great idea,
when in reality it just had an effective ad campaign behind it. Do your
homework by clicking into each video, and decide (based on the metrics)
if it looks like the views were a result of a paid campaign or not.
YouTube
The last tool Gowda recommends for coming up with content ideas and
Hook Points is YouTube. By searching beyond the obvious keywords that
most people in your space would use, you can take the extra step of digging
in and finding content that didn’t get a ton of views, and that may have
poor production value but that nevertheless offers little nuggets of gold. By
doing a granular search of this nature, Gowda has found ideas for some of
the highest-performing videos he’s ever made.
For example, one time he found a video of an older woman in China
folding clothing. She had a very slick technique—a one, two, three
approach that allowed her to fold a pile of T-shirts in seconds. Gowda’s
team took the concept, packaged the idea distinctively, promised good
communication, and it generated more than 300 million views.

98 HOOK POINT
Alternatively, you can search for ideas to repurpose from videos on
YouTube with high production value that also weren’t packaged correctly.
For example, Gowda once found a well-produced video of an April Fool’s
joke that only had 4,000 views. His team repurposed the idea, downgraded
the production value pretty heavily, and got 150 million views. In this case,
the lower production value felt more authentic for audiences and worked
better.
There is no one-dimensional truth in this space. You need to search, test,
and learn to come up with the best Hook Points and communication
design for each piece of content. Be willing to continually learn and grow
to find the best ways to share your message.
Quick Tips and Recap
• Choosing the right Hook Point and packaging content is
highly important for getting people to watch, share, click, and
purchase your content, products, and services.
• Set clear expectations for your content through the use of head-
lines, meme cards, or captions.
• The first three seconds of your digital videos make a promise to
your viewers. Make sure that promise is clear and intriguing.
• Your desired audience can do a myriad of other things with
their time, so present your content in a way that appeals to

CHAPTER 4
BECOME PRESIDENT
AND SAVE THE PLANET:
MASTERING THE ART OF
STORYTELLING
Whether it’s a young adult who’s just graduated from college or a billion-
aire who’s had a tremendous amount of success, people across the board
struggle to package their value propositions. They aren’t sure what makes
them unique and don’t know how to come up with a captivating and suc-
cinct story that both captures and holds people’s attention in our 3-second
world. Telling stories that speak to audiences and that meet their commu-
nication styles and needs is one of the most important skills you can learn.
When attempting to secure new business in a meeting, create a viral video
for social channels, or write copy to market your brand, you need to know
how to tell a story, quickly and efficiently, that shows people the value you
or your product can offer.
Over the years I’ve crafted several stories about who I am and what I do,
which include case studies about the clients I’ve worked with. While in

102 HOOK POINT
meetings, I ask questions to get an understanding of my prospects’ pain
points. Then, based upon their responses, I strategically choose to tell them
different variations of my stories based on their needs.
One time I was in a meeting with a gentleman named Michael Wright,
who, at the time, was CEO of Steven Spielberg’s film production company,
Amblin Entertainment. A partner of mine had set up the meeting, and
neither Wright nor I had any idea what the meeting was for—all we knew
was that it would have to take less than 25 minutes because Wright was
super busy.
We sat down, and I spent the first seven or eight minutes asking Wright
questions about Amblin Entertainment’s core focus. I asked what his goals
were as CEO, what he viewed as his core obstacles and roadblocks to suc-
cess, and the company’s current strategy to overcome those challenges. I
wanted to clearly understand how he operated, what his biggest pain points
were, and what he deemed valuable.
Wright told me that Amblin Entertainment was investing a lot of money
to launch a new brand initiative. They wanted to have the same level of
brand recognition as Marvel—because even though people know who
Steven Spielberg is, they don’t often recognize that Amblin Entertainment
produced movies such as E.T. the Extraterrestrial, Jurassic Park, or Saving
Private Ryan. The team was investing a lot of money and time in launching
a website where people could consume and engage with Amblin content,
but because of this lack of brand recognition, Wright feared that once
launched, the site would only receive a few thousand visits a month.
By asking the right questions and listening, I discovered that turning
Amblin into a brand that receives the level of recognition that Marvel has
was an important goal for Wright, and that the website was one of the key
steps in making that happen. In that moment I realized that I had a

Become President and Save the Planet 103
solution to his problem, and even more important, a Hook Point and story
to effectively communicate that solution. I knew I could help drive traffic
to the site at scale to solve Wright’s concern. The Hook Point was the fact
that in one month, we pushed close to seven million people to Yahoo!’s
website to consume Katie Couric’s content. Then, in the story, I broke
down the strategy we used for Couric and Yahoo! to drive traffic from
Facebook to her interviews on Yahoo!’s website at scale.
Within 20 minutes, I provided a very clear idea of how to overcome the
problem, and Wright was super excited about moving forward and finding
a way to work together. Our strategy was to identify strong Hook Points
within Amblin’s film library, leverage specific film clips and interviews that
best expressed those hooks, and A/B test them against each other to iden-
tify winning variations that would drive traffic at scale to their new
website.
In the end, we never actually launched the project because we ran into a
lot of politics with other parties involved, and Wright left Amblin
Entertainment to become president of Epix. Regardless, the way I lever-
aged the initial hook and story worked. It caught Wright’s attention, helped
build a relationship, and got him excited about working with my partner
and me.
Some meetings will go well and lead to more business, while others
won’t. What I want you to take away from this is the fact that even without
previously knowing what the meeting would be about, I found the pain
point, crafted a strategy in the moment, and wrapped it into a compelling
story to prove my value.

104 HOOK POINT
BE FLEXIBLE: AN IMPORTANT LESSON
THEY DON’T TEACH YOU IN YOGA
Prepare for meetings by coming up with a story that matches the Hook
Point that helped you get the meeting in the first place, but once in the
meeting, be flexible. Or, as in my case with Amblin Entertainment, if you
don’t know the hook that got you into the room, go in with the intent to
focus on listening, which helps you avoid one of the biggest mistakes peo-
ple make, which is having a preconceived pitch. This type of pitch makes
you say the same thing regardless of who’s sitting on the other side of the
table, which is not an effective strategy. Instead, it’s smart to take a step
back, think about the people you’re talking to, and listen to what they have
to say.
Take time to read body language and consider the mood of those in the
room. How do they respond to your questions? Get an idea of who they
are, and ease into the conversation. Thoroughly understanding them and
their needs will help dictate how you package your information. Not
every story will resonate with every person. Sometimes you need to tell a
different story—or your current story in a slightly different way—to be
effective.
I’M A SUPERHERO, NOT A COMEDIAN:
HOW TO PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS
When telling stories, it’s important to play up your personality strengths.
For example, I’m not a comedian. Generally, I don’t crack jokes or tell
funny stories; I’m a more serious and analytical person. My stories are
structured to follow this truth. If you, on the other hand, are a big

Become President and Save the Planet 105
personality and can tell funny jokes, work that into your stories. As long as
they don’t become a distraction and you don’t lose the trust and credibility
of your listeners, humor can add value. Use your authentic strengths to get
people to pay attention to you and want to work with you.
MIND THE TIME: SETTING A WORLD RECORD
FOR THE SHORTEST MEETING
It’s important to make sure you’re articulate, clear, concise, and to the
point. The stories I tell in meetings are typically anywhere from two to six
minutes long. I don’t go over that amount of time because the stories would
then become too drawn out. You also want to leave time for feedback,
questions, and to see how people are reacting. You don’t want to do a
30-minute presentation only to find out that the way you’re positioning
your story is not of value to the people on the other side of the table.
Besides, very important meetings are usually short, as important individu-
als have limited availability.
When creating content for social media, you don’t have this immediate
feedback loop and the ability to adjust on the fly. But you can measure the
success of each piece of content; notice its length, format, and structure;
and keep it in mind for the next video you produce. Remember to look at
the analytics and let them guide you. Additionally, you can be aware of the
consumption-behavior patterns on each platform. For example, Facebook
and Instagram are known for short-form consumption behavior while
YouTube can drive long-form consumption behavior, with some viewers
watching videos that are an hour long or more. Test different platforms and
various content formats to find what resonates most with your audience.

106 HOOK POINT
STORYTELLING FOR PUBLIC SPEAKING
As soon as Michael Breus, The Sleep Doctor, books a speaking
engagement, he talks to the event promoter to understand the
demographic of his audience. He wants to know the ratio of men to
women, their net worth, their occupations, and where they live.
Understanding these profiles is critically important because it helps
Breus adapt his presentation to meet the audience’s needs. I also apply
this tactic and have found it to be effective for my speaking career
as well.
If Breus is speaking to an audience composed of 90 percent men
and 10 percent women, he makes sure he has three case studies about
men. Even if men can identify with aspects of each woman in a case
study, it makes more sense to choose slides that better match the audi-
ence’s demographic and that speak to them directly.
Once he’s in the room delivering a speech, Breus usually puts up a
character profile and reads it to the audience. He then asks, “How
many of you identify with this person? If you do, raise your hand.”
Usually half of the group raise their hands immediately. Then he’ll
add, “Okay, from those of you who didn’t raise your hand, would
three of you raise your hand right now?” After three people have raised
their hands, he asks, “So what about this profile wasn’t you?” He lis-
tens and is usually able to find another case study in his deck that
meets their needs. He lets them know that they’ll be included in the
conversation by saying, “Oh, this is awesome, because later on I’m
going to talk about someone just like you, so hold tight.” This exercise
allows him to better understand his audience and gear his communi-
cation toward them.

Become President and Save the Planet 107
If your audience doesn’t feel spoken to, they’ll stop listening to
what you have to say, which is why Breus gives himself the power to
tailor his messages specifically to the people in the room. Knowing
the audience’s profiles helps him keep them more engaged during the
presentation as he customizes each section to their needs.
I recently experienced the power of tailoring messages to meet the
needs of an audience when I delivered a keynote speech to more than
7,000 dentists. I had never delivered my keynote to dentists, so I did
as much research and due diligence about who was in the room as I
could. Once I had this information, I reworked my entire speech,
specific to the needs of this audience, addressing their pain points,
challenges, and goals.
An additional trick Breus uses to keep audiences engaged is making
eye contact with every single person in the room. At some point
during the lecture, he looks at each individual, even if it’s only for a
half a second, because he wants each person to feel seen. It keeps audi-
ence members present and helps them feel more comfortable sharing
their sleep-related issues.
The final storytelling technique Breus uses to make the most of
speaking engagements is starting off Q&A sessions with questions
related to his best Hook Points. For example, he’ll open these sessions
by saying, “One of the questions I get asked all the time is, ‘Hey, Dr.
Breus, what’s the best mattress for sleep?’ or ‘Hey, Dr. Breus, when’s
the best time for sex before sleep?’” These Hook Point topics are inter-
esting, risqué, and leave people wanting to learn more.
Find out who your audience is so that you can best match their
needs. You’ll be more helpful and have more engagement if you truly
understand them.

108 HOOK POINT
THE PROCESS COMMUNICATION MODEL
The Process Communication Model (PCM) is a behavioral observational
tool that allows you to communicate more effectively. It’s been used by the
likes of NASA, Bill Clinton, and Pixar to help them achieve their business
and communication objectives. Jeff King, a PCM expert, gives us a brief
overview of the best ways to reach and engage audiences through the use of
this model.
King explains that when telling a story, you must think about your audi-
ence. If, instead, you tell stories that are focused solely on the way in which
you perceive the world, you’ll be on the wrong track. Unfortunately, that’s
what the majority of people do—subconsciously they gravitate toward
the vocabulary or currency in which they speak and only tell stories in
that vein.
In the PCM, there are six vocabularies that are related to the six
PCM personality types, which include Thinkers, Persisters, Harmonizers,
Imaginers, Rebels, and Promoters. Each personality type experiences the
world in a different way. Thinkers perceive the world through thoughts,
and logic is their currency. Persisters perceive the world through opinions,
and value is their currency. Harmonizers perceive the world through
emotions, and compassion is their currency. Imaginers perceive the world
through inactions, and imagination is their currency. Rebels perceive the
world through reactions, and humor is their currency. And Promoters per-
ceive the world through actions, and charm is their currency. All of the
personality types are in each of us, but we have a base personality type that
we’re born with that doesn’t change over the course of our lives. This base
personality dictates how we communicate to others, the preferred method
of how people communicate with us, and how we perceive and interact
with the world.

Become President and Save the Planet 109
If you’re a Thinker, for example, your preferred vocabulary is logic, and
you’ll tell stories with messages made up of 70 to 80 percent logic vocabu-
lary. Unfortunately, if Thinkers structure their stories in this way, they’ll
miss 75 percent of the population who are not of the Thinker personality
type. Effective storytellers, on the other hand, will use the logic, values,
humor, imagination, action, and emotions vocabularies. They will insert
messages for all six of the personality types so they can hook 100 percent of
the audience. Some employees at Pixar Animation Studios are trained in
the PCM and use the model successfully. When you watch a Pixar movie,
you see all six of the PCM vocabularies used throughout the storytelling
(generally represented by having a character that matches each personality
type). The fact that they speak to all of the personality types is one of the
reasons why their movies are so successful.
THE PCM COPY FOR ADS
Let’s try an exercise where we create copy to advertise a car. Using the
PCM, King explains how he would construct the content to make sure that
he communicated the clearest message about the car, wrapping it in a way
that makes sense for each of the personality types. King suggests writing
something like this:
Think of a car. This car model gets 50 miles per gallon. The car’s
miles per gallon are at the highest rate compared to other models
in its class. We believe that this car provides more value to our
customers in regard to what you’re going to pay for. Bottom
line—it’s the best car on the market. It feels good, it looks nice,
and you’re going to be so comfortable driving this car. All your

110 HOOK POINT
friends are finally going to want to hang out with you, because
this car is awesome.
Now let’s break this down to see which personality type each sentence
speaks to:
• These sentences use LOGIC and speak to Thinkers: “Think of
a car. This car model gets 50 miles per gallon. The car’s miles
per gallon are at the highest rate compared to other models in
its class.”
• This sentence uses VALUE and speaks to Persisters: “We
believe that this car provides more value to our customers in
regard to what you’re going to pay for.”
• This sentence uses CHARM and speaks to Promoters: “Bottom
line—it’s the best car on the market.”
• This sentence uses FEELINGS/COMPASSION and speaks to
Harmonizers: “It feels good, it looks nice, and you’re going to
be so comfortable driving this car.”
• This sentence uses HUMOR and speaks to Rebels: “All your
friends are finally going to want to hang out with you, because
this car is awesome.”
This ad speaks to the majority of the population, whereas most ads don’t—
they’re usually designed in the communication style of the person creating
them, thus alienating a vast percentage of the population who perceive the
world differently. This means that if a woman producing this car ad per-
ceived the world through opinions, she would likely focus on the currency

Become President and Save the Planet 111
of value in her communication and she’d lose the attention of those that
perceive the world through logic, action, reactions, and feelings.
THE PCM FOR MEETINGS AND JOB INTERVIEWS
Jeff King is the head of the MUSE School, and CEO of MUSE Global,
where they teach students from early childhood through the 12th grade.
All the teachers at the school are thoroughly trained in the PCM. That way,
no matter what the student’s preferred communication style is, MUSE
teachers can assess, connect with, and motivate each student.
By high school, all the students are also thoroughly trained in the PCM.
Campus visitors are often shocked by how well the students, whether two or
18 years old, communicate. By the time students have college or job inter-
views, they know how to effectively motivate the people in front of them
based on how they perceive the world. In fact, many colleges and universi-
ties make comments about how well MUSE students communicate.
King believes that a lot of educational facilities do not prepare our youth
for the working world. Often the focus is on memorizing and regurgitating
information, but they aren’t shown how to communicate, manage stress, or
negotiate conflict, which is exactly what the PCM teaches them.
If a person is unaware of the PCM, they’re more likely to disengage
interviewers. For example, if an interviewer asks a question based in logic,
such as, “How long did you work for Apple?” and the interviewee’s pre-
ferred language is emotions, the person may respond with an emotional
response such as, “I worked there for a few years and loved it. Apple is such
an amazing place.” Whereas, if someone is trained in the PCM and the
interviewer opens with this logic-based question, the person will respond

112 HOOK POINT
with a logic-based answer such as, “I worked there for four years and three
months.” Those trained in the PCM are more likely to stay in the same
vocabulary so that the interviewer remains engaged and connected.
Effectiveness in interviews and meetings comes from understanding the
perspective of those on the other side of the table. You want to meet their
needs. It’s not about going in and blurting out whatever is on your mind,
so try to actually understand the people on the other side of the table, and
communicate on their level so that you’re on the same page.
HOW BILL CLINTON LEVERAGED THE PCM
TO BECOME PRESIDENT
Bill Clinton is a great example of how the PCM can enhance your career. He
constantly uses it to assess others and connect with them, and he consistently
uses all six of the PCM vocabularies in his speeches. When Clinton ran for
president, he engaged just about 100 percent of his audience. He had all ears
on him—which is exactly what you want when you’re a public speaker.
One of the key turning points during the 1996 presidential election was
when Clinton won a critical debate against George Bush. King explains
that during the debate, a woman asked a question about how each party
would address the economic crisis and how it was affecting people’s lives.
She also stated that she felt the economic recession had negatively impacted
her own life, as well as her friends’ and family’s. Bush responded to the
question with thoughts and logic, as well as value and opinions. However,
the woman perceived the world through feelings and emotions, so Bush’s
answer didn’t connect with her.
On the other hand, Bill Clinton picked up on her communication style
right away. He responded to her personally and shared that he felt her pain.

Become President and Save the Planet 113
He also explained how he felt about the economic recession and how it had
affected him and his life. He connected with her on a deep and feeling-based
level because he saw that she was a feeling-based person (like 30 percent of
the North American population). By using those words, he immediately
gained the trust of the people in that group and made the woman (and
those like her) feel understood and heard.
Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, did not follow in her husband’s
footsteps. One of the reasons she lost the election to Donald Trump was
because she only spoke two vocabularies: logic and values. King thinks that
Hillary Clinton may have been the most qualified person to ever run for
president of the United States, but because she only spoke in logic and
values, she wasn’t accessible to a significant portion of the North American
population.
The PCM teaches that when people are in a positive life position, we can
speak from all six vocabularies and can effectively connect and appreciate
the diversity of all six personality types. When we’re in a negative life posi-
tion, we’re in what the PCM refers to as distress. When we’re in distress, we
behave in a way that is negative to those around us. Thus, we’re not con-
cerned about the well-being of others or about connecting with others to
motivate them in a positive way.
Trump usually communicates in distress from his Promoter personality
type. Promoters in distress are willing to say whatever it takes to appease
their audience. Promoter distress behavior is to manipulate people and to
get them to argue and fight with one another. King points out that Trump
has said things like, “I’m going to turn my taxes over,” or “I will sit down
with Robert Mueller.” King believes Trump never had any intention of
doing either of those things—he only said them because he knew that it
was what his audience wanted to hear.

114 HOOK POINT
Promoters can also be very skilled at manipulating people and setting
groups up against each other. Over the past couple of years, and even while
Trump was running for the election, he pinned groups against each other
so he could step back and say, “Well, they’re not getting along. I have to go
in and save the day.”
When promoters are not in distress, they can act in positive ways, just
like any other personality type. Each personality has a positive and negative
(distressed) side. The PCM teaches individuals how to keep themselves in a
positive life position and how to help others move from distress to a more
positive life position.
YOU WANT TO SAVE THE PLANET?
Unfortunately, King finds that environmentalists are often some of the worst
communicators on the planet. In fact, the majority of people who tell stories
with the intent to spark change run into a common problem. Although
they’re usually filled with wonderful passion for their cause, it often leads
them astray. You very rarely see an environmentalist get up and speak to all
six of the personality types, like Bill Clinton. Instead, they tend to speak in
values or logic, which only hits a very narrow segment of the population.
They don’t engage a large portion of their audience, and therefore don’t
engage a large area of the country. King believes that failure to communicate
effectively has slowed progress on solving environmental issues.
An example of failure to communicate effectively is when an environ-
mentalist says, “You know, we should stop eating fish because the ocean is
going to run out of fish, and besides, all the fish are filled with plastic. If
you eat fish, something’s wrong with you because you don’t care about the
oceans and you don’t care about our environment.”

Become President and Save the Planet 115
Honestly, who’s going to listen to that? From a fact perspective, the envi-
ronmentalist may be 100 percent correct, but when speakers belittle and
attack their audience, those who are listening get turned off and lose trust
in those people. Words such as should, ought, and need, or statements like
“Something’s wrong with you if you don’t do what I want you to do” don’t
inspire change.
Instead, environmentalists—or anyone for that matter—would benefit
from trying to share a message that hits all six currencies. A better speech
would be:
We love the oceans and the fish so much. The data states that
we’re going to run out of fish by 2030. We strongly believe that
we have to find some alternatives to fish because we want our
oceans to be awesome for many generations. Imagine a future
where we have an abundance of fish and where the waters are
not polluted. Join me so we can take action now.
Each sentence in this speech speaks directly to one of the six PCM person-
ality types.
THE PCM AND MOVIES
Only 5 percent of the North American population has the Promoter per-
sonality type (people who perceive the world through actions and use charm
as their currency). They are unique because they take big risks and have a lot
of charisma. What is fascinating about Promoters is that they inspire the
other 95 percent of the population because non-Promoters wouldn’t feel as
comfortable taking those risks. King says that a lot of successful film trailers

116 HOOK POINT
and movies have a main character with a Promoter personality type, which
helps entice people to show up at the box office. When audiences watch a
character such as Iron Man, James Bond, or even con man Frank Abagnale
(played by Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can), they feel moved in
some way and think, I would love to be that character. You’ll also find that
Promoters often find their way into major leadership roles because of this as
well (i.e., Steve Jobs, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump).
PCM FOR TV COMMERCIALS
Although movies and trailers tend to do better with Promoters as the lead
characters in their stories, advertisers need to think more broadly when it
comes to TV commercials. King explains that in these ads, it’s beneficial for
advertisers to play the numbers game, hitting emotions with 30 percent of
their messaging, logic with 25 percent, humor with 20 percent, and per-
haps values with 10 percent. Essentially, they need to use a wide range of
the PCM languages in order to capture a larger audience.
The Dollar Shave Club created a video called DollarShaveClub.com—
Our Blades Are F***ing Great, which spread the PCM language very effec-
tively. The video went viral shortly after it was released in 2012 and
currently has more than 26 million views. It helped the company launch,
and led to their acquisition by Unilever for more than $1 billion.

believes that the storytelling in this video worked because it used logic,
emotion, and humor in its messaging, which reaches the largest percentage

of the population and helped them knock it out of the park in terms of
capturing audiences’ attention.
THE PCM FOR SOCIAL CONTENT DESIGN
When designing content for online distribution, the story you tell should
hit all the different ways in which people perceive the world. Again, emo-
tions, logic, and humor are the top three vocabularies in North America, so
if that’s your main audience, try to design content with those elements in
videos, articles, and posts.
Unfortunately, most content designers focus too heavily on the way they
perceive the world, alienating a huge percentage of the population. They
end up subconsciously communicating to themselves when they should be
communicating to their audience. If your preferred vocabulary is logic,
don’t tell a story using only this vocabulary. Remember that communica-
tion is never about you; it’s always about those you’re speaking to.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN A WORLD OF
HEROES AND DRAGONS . . .
Telling a story in a room where no one is listening is not effective. To avoid
this, Erick Brownstein’s team at Shareability begins story creation by dis-
covering what makes people care about the brand they’re creating content
for. Mike Jurkovac, the Emmy Award–winning director/producer at
TheBridge.co, does the same and says that if you don’t find a way to con-
nect emotionally with your consumers, you’re wasting your time.
Brownstein explains that if you have a sneaker line, it’s not enough to tell
a story about the fact that your shoes have good support. There are a lot of

118 HOOK POINT
sneakers with good support, which is why brands like Nike take risks.
They get people to pay attention with Emmy Award–winning ads such as
“Dream Big,” featuring Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback.
Kaepernick’s protests against police brutality and racial inequality during
the national anthem were controversial. Nike took a chance when they
featured him in their commercials, but it shared their values and got people
talking. There was a huge payoff when stock prices reached an all-time
high immediately after the ad was released.

Copywriter Ernest Lupinacci adds this tip to make stories more share-
able: “Hypothetically, you could argue that every brand story, in regard to
its proposition to the customer, could be structured like a fairy tale.” For
example, Lupinacci explains, we’re all familiar with fairy tales that have
been told for centuries that follow this three-act format: “Once upon a
time, everything was fine, until a dragon showed up. Then a hero came
along and killed the dragon, and then in the epilogue, we learn that every-
one lived happily ever after in the new world.”
Lupinacci suggests that structuring your brand’s story like a fairy tale
makes it more shareable. If he were to create a fairy tale for BMW, it
would be:
Once upon a time, everyone aspired to drive a good domestic
car, right? You know, you dreamed of owning a Cadillac. And
then along came a dragon called Too Much Choice. It included

inexpensive and expensive Japanese cars, super expensive
European cars, and way too many domestic cars. All of a sudden
none of the cars available seemed satisfying. Then a knight
showed up named BMW—the Ultimate Driving Machine.
Everyone who ended up driving that car lived happily
ever after.
Essentially, if your product is the solution to your customer’s “dragon,” and
you tell it in a shareable way, more people are likely to pay attention to
what you have to say.
YOU KNOW HOW YOU WISH THERE WAS
A SIMPLE FORMULA FOR SUCCESS?
Lupinacci’s favorite phrase to help find concepts for Hook Points or copy
for any brand, product, or service is: “You know how . . . ?” Essentially, you
share your idea with people by beginning with the phrase “You know
how . . .” in each sentence to see if they agree. For example, when Lupinacci
relaunched the Dasani brand, he knew that the other bottled-water com-
panies’ selling points were focused on the premise that water is healthy and
that it comes from a good source. But Lupinacci was intuitively aware that
when people drink the beverages they like, they aren’t so much driven by
how healthy they are or where they come from as much as whether or not
they like the taste. In addition, while a lot of people don’t think water has
a taste, Lupinacci knew that this simply wasn’t the case. Most people can
absolutely tell the difference between tap water and bottled water, and each
bottled water has a different taste.

120 HOOK POINT
So, Lupinacci capitalized on all these insights and truths and used the
following “You know how . . . ?” logic to see if other people would agree
with his theory. He structured his thinking as follows:
You know how there are 75,000 water brands in the market,
and we’re supposed to drink eight glasses of water a day? “Yeah,
I do know that. I hear it all the time. People repeat that to me.
There’s one of those giant water coolers in my office. Water,
water, water, water.” Well, you know how you can’t figure out if
one is better than the other? “Yeah.” Well, you know how at the
end of the day, whatever you drink or eat still needs to appeal to
you? It’s got to taste good; otherwise, it’s medicine, right? “Yeah,
I do know that.” Well, you should try some Dasani. “What
makes it so special?” Dasani is the water that makes your mouth
water.
By doing this exercise, Lupinacci can quickly tell how effective his cam-
paign ideas actually are.
The next time you come up with a hook, a story, or a new business plan,
tell your concept to someone with the “You know how . . . ?” structure and
see if it passes the test. If the majority of people do not resonate with your
message, you’ll know you’re off track. And if people nod their heads yes to
what you have to say, you’ll be closer to knowing your next Hook Point.
IS THIS THE KIND OF ATTENTION YOU WANT?
When marketing any product or service, your job is to get people to pay
attention. However, it’s important to be wary of what kind of attention you

Become President and Save the Planet 121
elicit. Attention doesn’t always translate to success, especially when your
messages aren’t properly aligned with the theme of your products.
For example, to digitally market the movie Rings, the third movie in The
Ring trilogy, Paramount’s team developed a hook that made their promo-
tional videos go viral. The digital team filmed customers’ reactions to the
main character of Rings scaring them at various electronic stores. Customers
are seen shopping for TVs and then screaming out of fear as the creepy
girl from the movie walks toward them out of the TV. (You can watch the
customer reactions in the video: Rings (2017)–TV Store Prank: www
.brendanjkane.com/rings.)
Rings (2017)–TV Store Prank received around ten million views.
However, while the content promoting the film went viral, the movie itself
didn’t. The video made people laugh, and that was part of its hook, but
Rings is in the horror genre, so telling a story that produced laughter wasn’t
in line with the overall theme or reaction that a viewer would have to the
movie itself. To attract the right audience, it probably would have been
more effective to elicit fear instead of laughter in the video.
Creating something that hooks people doesn’t matter if it’s not the right
kind of hook. Make sure your stories grab attention that are aligned with
the overall message/theme of your products. If you fail to do so, you may
produce a buzz, but ultimately you won’t reach the people who want what
you have to offer.
YOUR BRAND IS NOT THE HERO OF YOUR STORY
Erick Brownstein of Shareability explains that when we tell stories, the
brand should not be positioned as the hero. For example, Shareability has
created several videos for Adobe that tell stories related to sensitive issues.

122 HOOK POINT
One video called Students Help Victims of Hurricane Harvey Restore Lost
Memories | Adobe Creative Cloud shows how students helped restore family
photos destroyed in the hurricane. If the stories in these videos weren’t
authentic, and/or were exploitative, people would have quickly noticed. To
avoid that situation, the Adobe brand needed to position itself in the back-
ground. The heroes in the videos are the victims, the students, and the local
nonprofits that helped them. Adobe does not try to steal the spotlight, but
rather acts as the theater or stage where a light is shined on these issues and
heroes. The more a brand takes a back seat to the heroic characters, the
more trust and credibility they can build with their audience.
Red Bull has leveraged a similar marketing tactic. On their website and
in social content, they feature athletes from every sport. Whether it’s a
climbing, basketball, or cricket star, they create the stage on which to tell a
story about these accomplished individuals. Again, they don’t talk about
their sports drinks; instead, they make the athletes the heroes of the
stories.
In fact, in 2012 Red Bull invested more than $60 million to stage, film,
and promote its Stratos event, which featured supersonic skydiver Felix
Baumgartner’s jump from a helium balloon in the stratosphere more than
24 miles above earth’s surface. 
51 
Baumgartner reached speeds of up to 725
miles per hour and broke three world records, including breaking the
sound barrier at Mach 1.24.

Red Bull staged the event and used its

production company, Red Bull Media House; and TV channel, ServusTV;
to distribute images to various other media outlets. Additionally, YouTube’s
live stream “recorded more than 340 million site views before the actual
jump.” At the time, the event helped YouTube set a new record, with more
than eight million viewers watching simultaneously. 
53 
Owen Gibson of
The Guardian reported that major brands “have been talking for years
about becoming content producers rather than simply paying media and
rights owners to advertise or slap their logos on shirts and hoardings. But
none have taken it as seriously as Red Bull.”
54 
The amount of time and
money that Red Bull invested in this event proves that they value the
impact of making athletes the heroes of their stories—not to mention,
“skydiving from space” is a crazy-good Hook Point.
Brownstein explains that even when creating business-to-business (B2B)
videos, they don’t put the business they’re creating the video for in the
spotlight. For example, they made a B2B video for the Adobe Experience
Cloud. One of Adobe’s clients that uses this product is St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital. In the content Shareability created for Adobe, they told
the story of how the hospital uses Adobe’s technology to be more effective
in their work. St. Jude’s and its customers are the heroes of the story, while
Adobe, like Red Bull, acts as the stage.
Another company that knows how to stay in the background of their
marketing efforts is Nike. When they created the aforementioned

124 HOOK POINT
campaign with former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, they didn’t focus the
content around Nike at all. Kaepernick and his activism were the heroes of
the story. People thought that taking a stand like that would kill the com-
pany, but instead, as noted, it drove their stock price through the roof.
Another stand-out example of great storytelling from Nike is their
Dream Crazier video. It intercuts images of female athletes and coaches
yelling and crying in different sports-related scenarios, explaining that peo-
ple often label women’s emotions or forthrightness as “crazy.” Then it shows
images of the first time a woman boxed or became a sports coach and
explains that when they were first starting out, these women were also con-
sidered crazy. The message is that when seemingly crazy women take a
stand, they become powerful and debunk myths about how women should
act. Nike urges women to “dare to be crazy” so they can show people what
crazy can accomplish.
Again, the video doesn’t center around Nike. It simply tells a compelling
story about the strength and power of women. Nike is only present because
many of the athletes are wearing their clothing, we can see their logos at the
end of the video, and they’re the ones setting the stage.
Brownstein reminds us that storytelling is not primarily rational—it’s
emotional—which is one good reason why it’s wise to get people to fall in
love with your brand. He advises that to do so, you should take some hints
from how actual loving relationships are formed. For example, they’re not
built through manipulation or by constantly asking others to take actions
for you. To receive love, you have to give love. When you’re generous, you
receive. With brands and their audiences, the best way to earn people’s
attention and gain the right to ask for their business is by giving them
value. By choosing to focus on building loving relationships with your
audience, you’ll tell better stories and touch more people’s hearts.

Become President and Save the Planet 125
Besides, people care more about themselves than your brand. If your
brand is in the spotlight, people will tune you out. Instead, focus on the
reactions you can elicit from your audience and on providing them with
value.
WHERE BRANDS GO WRONG
Brownstein points out that oftentimes the metrics by which content is
measured don’t line up with telling good brand stories. Return on invest-
ment doesn’t necessarily fit into brand building, and return on ad spend
doesn’t always relate to the value you can receive from content that builds
up your brand. When you create content that’s focused on storytell-
ing, brand building, and driving engagement, you’re not necessarily trying
to get people to click and buy products or services. Engagement-and-
conversion campaigns can go hand in hand, but they’re not necessarily one
and the same. Brownstein sees a lot of brands trying to achieve two differ-
ent results with one piece of content, which can be ineffective, inefficient,
and perceived as inauthentic. Trying to mix two different objectives can
make audiences feel like they’re watching a commercial as opposed to
receiving content that has value.
It’s essential to understand the difference between a piece of content or
message that serves to tell a story to build a brand, versus a piece of content
or message that’s created to sell a product. When trying to achieve both
objectives, Brownstein’s team at Shareability uses a “full-funnel activation”
strategy. First, they will often start with big, viral, shareable content; then
they move on to content that causes additional engagement but still doesn’t
necessarily push a strong call to action; and finally, they’ll often push con-
tent to people who engaged with the first two pieces of content, asking

126 HOOK POINT
them to take an action (for example a click, download, or purchase) related
to their clients’ goals.
The Cricket Wireless campaign with John Cena in 2016, The Unexpected
John Cena Prank video, brought an internet meme to life when Cena sur-
prised fans who thought they were auditioning to be in a Cricket Wireless
commercial. When the fans pretended to introduce John Cena, he actually
burst through a poster of himself. The fans’ reactions were priceless—you
can see them here: www.brendanjkane.com/cena. Shareability launched
this video on Facebook and YouTube and generated more than 235 million
views overall! Then they produced a second, follow-up video, John Cena
Reacts, which was actually part of a bigger campaign that Shareability
launched called “John Cena Loves the Internet.”
John Cena Reacts flipped the script of the original video. It was the reverse
of the original Unexpected John Cena. In the second video, fans surprised
Cena instead of Cena surprising the fans. He was opening fan mail thank-
ing him for his “Never give up” motto that helped them bounce back from
injuries and heartache. Then, as the video progresses, Cena gets emotional
watching a clip of a young boy thanking him for helping his mother battle
cancer. After the clip finishes, the son surprises Cena by coming through
the same poster from the first video with his mother to thank Cena in per-
son. He gets extremely emotional, and we see a beautiful exchange of grat-
itude between all involved.
One of the reasons these campaigns were highly successful was because
they didn’t ask for anything—their only purpose was to provide value to
the audience, from making them laugh in the first Cena video to touching
their hearts in the second. The second video became the most shared ad in
the world in 2017 and was number three on YouTube’s trending videos.
On Facebook, it drove more than 2.5 million shares and 110 million views

Become President and Save the Planet 127
on the original upload and more than 175 million total views, including
audience re-uploads. The entire “John Cena Loves the Internet” campaign
gained nearly three million total shares and ten million engagements across
platforms.
After the success of the first two videos, Shareability’s team continued to
bring value to the campaign by creating video ads to retarget the people
who’d engaged with the content. They followed up with messages from
Cena encouraging viewers to visit the Cricket Wireless website. The people
who saw these more traditional ads were those who already felt a strong
connection to Cena (and by extension, Cricket) because the original con-
tent was emotional and engaging. Fans are more likely to take notice, pay
attention, and take action when they feel an authentic connection.
Brownstein adds that when you focus on providing value, you can end
up with great, and sometimes unexpectedly wonderful, results. One time,
for a major pet-products company, Shareability had 800,000 people click
through to a website from two videos that were not primarily intended to
be traffic drivers. This happened because the content was so compelling
that it increased the effectiveness of the call to action at the end of the
video: “If you want to learn more about how you can make the world a
better place for pets, go here.”
I also agree with entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, who believes that
info-product people are just out to make a buck and sell products—
although they do make money, they’re not looking at the longer-term vision
of building a brand, which ultimately causes them to struggle. Instead,
Vaynerchuk and I urge people to focus on giving away value in content to
build a brand that attracts larger clients. With that in mind, a lot of value
can be driven from direct-response advertising content. The majority of
people simply make the mistake of taking a brand-building piece of

128 HOOK POINT
content and turning it into a direct-response piece of content, and vice
versa. However, I’ve been experimenting, researching, and testing how
both brand-building and direct-response content can play off of each other,
and thus far the results have been remarkable. Again, you have to come
from an authentic and value-driven place, but if you interchange
brand-building with direct-response content, both can drive results.
DIGITAL STORYTELLING VISUAL DESIGN TIPS
Digital content strategist Naveen Gowda spent a lot of time studying how
people become top performers on YouTube, which is a long-form con-
sumption-behavior platform that you can get people to tune in to for long
periods of time. Gowda studied vloggers and individual brands on the plat-
form and found that those who are successful share similar communication
styles.
Effective communication design came down to factors such as the col-
ors, pacing, and lighting in a video—a lot of seemingly smaller details had
a huge impact on a video’s success. For example, Gowda discovered that a
disproportionately high ratio of the top performers, who were averaging
four or five million views on a single video, were overenunciating their
words. YouTubers who didn’t overenunciate weren’t receiving high num-
bers of views, regardless of the similarities in the messaging of their con-
tent. After studying all the details that made videos successful, Gowda has
developed a deep understanding of communication design. These days, he
can take video concepts that aren’t necessarily strong and get them to
receive hundreds of millions of views.
Remember, it’s important to consider the visual and auditory aspects of
your stories, because concepts presented with visuals are learned more

Become President and Save the Planet 129
easily and are more frequently recalled. Using this fact to your advantage
keeps people interested in watching your content. And don’t forget to study
your competitors for shortcuts to making the right visual choices. If you
take the time to see how they’re handling the communication design of
their videos, you could save hours of time and achieve better results more
quickly.
(If you’re struggling to get your social content to perform and would
like assistance from Naveen Gowda and me, we have several differ-
ent options for you to work with us here: www.brendanjkane.com
/work-with-brendan/.)
SATISFYING TO WATCH
Gowda believes that the most important part of storytelling on digital plat-
forms is creating videos that are satisfying to watch. Luckily, there are myr-
iad ways to generate satisfying visual effects. He cites the example of
watching a video of a person putting his or her fingers in goop—“it’s
enjoyable to watch, even if no one can truly explain why.” Satisfaction can
also come from watching a person speed-paint or fill in a whiteboard—as
you follow along, you want to continue watching to reach the sense of
completion you’ll receive at the end. This is especially effective when you
watch videos of plants growing in super-sped-up time—they tend to be
visually satisfying because you see the whole thing develop in a way you’d
never get to in real life. You get the full picture and, again, a sense of
completion.
Think about your audience’s viewing satisfaction while creating content,
and it will lead to more viewers. Visual surprises and delights can enhance
your marketing materials and social videos.

TELLING STORIES VIA EMAIL:
CRAFTING COLD OUTREACH EMAILS
Sales come out of relationships, which is why referrals are the best way to
connect with the potential companies you’d like to work with. There are
times, however, when you don’t have connections to the people you’d like
to meet. In that case, you need to find a way to forge those relationships.
Tools such as LinkedIn can help you make these types of connections, but
with the bombardment of messages that people receive on this platform,
email is still king.
Email is more effective than direct messaging on LinkedIn because fewer
people have access to email addresses of people they don’t know—it’s still
the standard way to proposition your products and services to others.
Besides, people on LinkedIn rarely check their in-boxes; they aren’t man-
aged as diligently as with email. Also, when you don’t know someone, cold
emails are more effective than cold calls. It’s usually best to wait until you’ve
been introduced or have had at least one in-person meeting before calling
a cold target, which is why your ability to get people to pay attention to
emails can greatly enhance your career, and perhaps even help you close
your biggest deals.
One time a friend of mine closed a deal worth tens of millions of dollars
that started with a cold outreach email. He did some research on LinkedIn
to find the key players at the company he wanted to target. When he found
the president of the department he wanted to reach, he figured out the
person’s email address by testing various email formats (a process described
later in this chapter). Once he found that email address, he sent a message
that said, “Hey, I have a couple of friends who’ve started a company. It
would be great to learn what you think about it because I’m considering
taking a job there.”

Become President and Save the Planet 131
This person got back to my friend fairly quickly and offered to meet up
for coffee. At the end of the meeting, the president of the department said,
“Take the job and tell them to come into town. I think there’s a lot we can
do together.” That meeting led to a new job for my friend, and again, a deal
worth tens of millions of dollars that all started with a cold outreach email.
Most people never get responses from those types of emails, but if you can
finesse your approach through the art of A/B testing, it can lead to some-
thing big.
Cold Outreach Email Headlines
The first trick to writing successful cold outreach emails is to use the sub-
ject lines to state your Hook Points. For example, in the email my friend
sent to the president of the department, the subject line was: “Hey, can I
get your advice on something?” He was not trying to sell this person any-
thing. Let me say that again: He was not trying to sell this person anything.
And yet, it led to one of the biggest sales of his career.
I emphasize this point because generally people do cold outreach all
wrong (especially on LinkedIn). They try to sell people their products or
services right off the bat. I’ll talk more about why this approach doesn’t
work in chapter 7, but for now, just realize that especially in your first
batch of cold outreach emails, you should not be trying to sell anyone
anything.
The Body of a Cold Outreach Email
In the body of my friend’s email, he created copy that stood out and that
didn’t come across as pushy. He simply asked for the person’s thoughts:

132 HOOK POINT
“We don’t know each other, but this opportunity seems really interesting.
I’m considering working here, and I’d like your opinion about it.” Taking
this approach allowed his target to think, Hey, okay, the guy’s not trying to sell
me anything, which was also authentic—in the moment my friend sent the
first email, he truly wasn’t trying to sell that person anything; he simply
wanted his advice and perspective. The honest desire to learn opened the
door to what later became a highly lucrative deal.
A/B Test Cold Outreach Emails
I recommend that you A/B test both your headlines and your email copy
to learn which variations are most effective at reaching your target audi-
ence. First, build an email target list through research on LinkedIn. For
example, if you want to reach out to entertainment companies in Los
Angeles, identify 100 of them and search for their founders or manage-
ment teams. Then, work to uncover their email addresses.
Finding email addresses is usually the most tedious and time-consuming
part of the process. There are some online tools that can help you get a
high probability of what the email address may be, such as hunter.io,
Findthat.email, or Clearbit, or you can search a proposed email address
and look for a match on Google. Another strategy is to see if that person
has written an article, because oftentimes their email address is mentioned
in those articles.
Once you’ve found the email addresses you wish to target, put your list
into customer relationship management (CRM) software such as HubSpot,
Salesforce, or Freshsales. Then build out an email cadence with up to
five emails. I don’t recommend building out more than four or five emails,
because more than that is overkill. If your target doesn’t respond after four

Become President and Save the Planet 133
or five emails, it’s time to change the copy and move on to another person
at the company.
An example of a four-email sequence structure is as follows:
Email 1: Top-line overview of how you can solve a specific pain
point of the target’s business through your services and products.
Email 2: Restate your services and products and see if they’re
interested. Possibly add an example, or list relevant clients you’ve
worked with.
Email 3: Apologize for following up, and ask a question to see if
the person’s goals/objectives align with your services.
Email 4: Send a simple email asking if the person has time to
connect.
Email 1 goes out on day one, email 2 goes out on day three, email 3 on day
five, and email 4 on day seven. From there, measure the responses to differ-
ent versions of each email. Test three versions of email 1 by changing the
copy in the first paragraph of version 2; then change the subject line of
version 3. Try to keep the changed variable simple so it’s easy to identify the
change that causes a successful response.
For example, in a sequence, you may try two different value points in
email 1 to see which picks up more interest. The first email from Group A
could have a subject line that says: “Stimulating [targeted company’s name]
growth with social media marketing,” while the subject line in the first
email of Group B’s could say: “Social media marketing and how it can
stimulate [targeted company’s name] consumers in Los Angeles.”
When sending out these two different emails, split the leads, meaning
send 50 different companies the Group A emails, and then 50 more people

134 HOOK POINT
at different companies the Group B emails. Then review which emails get a
response. In case you don’t get a response from any of the Group A emails,
email another person at the same company using the Group B emails. Make
sure to continue to A/B test until you find the absolute best email copy.
HOW TO WRITE COPY THAT QUADRUPLES YOUR SALES
Writing captivating copy is an essential skill. If you can’t communicate
your hooks effectively, you won’t be seen or heard. To help you become a
better copywriter, I recommend reading a book by Michael Masterson and
John Forde called Great Leads: The Six Easiest Ways to Start Any Sales
Message. In the book, they talk about the six best openers for copy, which
include “The Offer Lead,” “The Problem-Solution Lead,” “The Big Secret
Lead,” “The Proclamation Lead,” and “The Story Lead.” For our purposes,
I’m going to focus on the Proclamation Lead, as I believe it’s a tool that can
help you write effective hooks and stories.
A Proclamation Lead begins with an emotionally compelling statement
in the form of a headline. It is bold, makes a promise about an imagined
benefit, and is of a relevant subject to the prospect. Also, it’s often based on
a prediction about a future outcome that catches people by surprise. The
goal is to raise curiosity with a promise that can “push the envelope of the
incredible.” However, for the bold statement to work, the copy that follows
must provide information that proves the validity of that claim/promise.
Additionally, a good Proclamation Lead does not reveal the most import-
ant aspect of the product or service until the end of the copy.
Great Leads explains that one of the most successful sales letters ever,
written in order to sell the Journal of Alternatives, started with the headline
“Read This or Die.” This text grabs the attention of prospects, making

Become President and Save the Planet 135
readers wonder what information could be so important that they would
die if they didn’t have it. Then, once that hook grabs their attention, the
following copy makes a bold prediction: “Today you have a 95 percent
chance of eventually dying from a disease or condition for which there is
already a known cure somewhere on the planet. The editor of Alternatives
would like to free you from that destiny.” The lead gets people to think,
Gee, if the statement about having a 95 percent chance of dying from a curable
disease is really true, I better find out more about this. Someone who is inter-
ested in health-related information will want to read on.
Another example of a Proclamation Lead in the form of a prediction is:
“Countdown to Crisis! Three Shocking Events will wipe out millions of
American investors by Dec. 31, 2006. . . .” Readers immediately wonder
what three events could happen to cause this effect by the end of the year—
their curiosity is piqued. The copy that follows then provides credibility for
the prediction, explaining that it comes from a “famous market analyst.”
The emotionally compelling statement hooks readers into the story that
follows. Masterson and Forde add that a great Proclamation Lead “can’t be
written, it must be found,” and the best way to find one is through research.
You need to come across proof that backs up your proclamation so that it
can truly stand out and be disruptive in a credible way.
To find a great Proclamation Lead (or any type of lead/hook, for that
matter) for your brand, copywriter Craig Clemens suggests writing a para-
graph about your prospect’s fears, desires, and needs. Then, think about
how your product or brand can improve your prospect’s life. (If you have
data that proves exactly how bad your prospect’s problem is or how good
your solution is, even better.) Finally, find the intersection of where your
prospect’s problem and your solution meet, and create copy (or a social
media video script) using that intersection as the main message.

A GOLDEN FORMULA TO MAKE YOUR MESSAGE RESONATE
On the podcast Business Lunch with Roland Frasier, Clemens outlines a
four-step copywriting formula called “Impact Arcs” that gets your audi-
ence’s attention. The process is as follows:
1. A(sk) a “Yes” question, one your potential customer would
answer yes to—that is, “Do you want to make maximum return
on your money that is just sitting in the bank? ‘Yes.’ Then con-
sider buying art.”
2. R(eveal) that you’ve been in your audience’s position—a place
that is usually as far from successful as they would like to be in
this area. Set the stage to show that through experience, you’ve
learned critical information that can help them get there. Reveal
something that is true and that made you strive to learn more—
for example, “I used to look for places to invest my money, but
I didn’t know I could get a large return by buying art,” or “I
wanted to do it, but I didn’t know where to start.”
3. C(all) out the discovery that brought you out of the fog. Here,
you explain what you learned that helped you get where you are
now, which will help your audience arrive there too—that is, “I
discovered a book by J Paul Getty, How to Get Rich, where he
explains how he made wealth through art. It was really interest-
ing, but I wasn’t sure if these principles would apply to the cur-
rent art world. I decided to meet with a prominent art investor
who’s made tens of millions of dollars from art. I showed him
the book, and he explained how to apply the information to
today’s art world. I started using the principles, and over the last

Become President and Save the Planet 137
five years I’ve averaged a 30 percent return annually, which is
larger than my return from the stock market.”
4. S(end) them to do something. This is your call to action, and the
desired impact of your communication. This is where you get
them to sign up for your email list, buy your book, or follow
your account—for example, “I put the strategies up on a web
page that is totally free that you can check out here,” or “Sign up
for my email list, where I’ll reveal these tips one by one.”
The formula can be used in one sentence, paragraph, video, or in an hour-
long presentation. Listen to Clemens discuss the technique here: https://

focus on the reactions you can elicit from your audience and on
providing them with value.
5. Tell a story that gets your audience to feel connected, fall in love,
and take ownership of the story you’re telling. If you focus on
building a loving relationship with your audience, you’ll have
more loyal customers.
6. To generate significant views on your videos, think about com-
munication design, including the visual and auditory aspects of
your videos, as well as your audience’s viewing-satisfaction level.
7. If used properly, cold outreach emails can be a gold mine in
connecting with high-value prospects.
8. Use the subject line of cold outreach emails to state your Hook
Point. Then A/B test your copy to see which emails get the best
responses.
9. When writing copy to sell products or services, find the intersec-
tion of where your prospect’s problem and your solution meet,
and create copy (or a social media video script) using that inter-
section as the main message.
10. Use the “Impact Arcs” four-step copywriting formula to arc-in
prospects.

HOW TO AVOID PRISON TIME:
A MASTER CLASS IN
AUTHENTICITY, TRUST, AND
CREDIBILITY
Whitney Wolfe, founder of the dating app Bumble, set out on a mis-
sion to empower women. She wanted to change the double standard in the
dating world, which expects females to act coy and refrain from going after
what they want. She hoped to change these dynamics by getting women to
make the first move, so she created a dating app that requires females to
send the initial messages to men they’re interested in on the platform.
As a graduate of Southern Methodist University, Wolfe went to the var-
ious sorority houses on campus and spoke about how women have the
right to get what they want. She explained that relationships don’t have to
be male dominated and that men appreciate being relieved from the pres-
sure to pursue. By transmitting her excitement about changing social
norms, Wolfe inspired these women to download the app. Then she went
over to the frat houses and told the guys that there were hundreds of girls

140 HOOK POINT
waiting to go out with them. Additionally, she gave the men a slice of pizza
and cookies in exchange for downloading the app.
The Hook Point of creating a platform that was built to change dating
dynamics and empower women led to a current 52 million downloads and
$335 million in revenue.
56 
This was quite an accomplishment, especially
considering how crowded the dating-app space was when Wolfe launched
back in December of 2014.
57
Part of what has made Bumble so successful is Wolfe’s authenticity. The
brand is connected to her mission in life and was created with purpose.
This authentic desire to create change has set her apart, made her stand
out, and helped her company rise to success.
WHY DO YOU GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING?
Authenticity supports your ability to make a mark in our 3-second world
because it helps your Hook Points stick. Without authenticity and purpose
behind your hooks, stories, and products/services, they will lack substance
and fall flat. If you’re familiar with Simon Sinek’s book Start With Why, you
know that he urges brands to “clearly articulate why they do what they do.”
A brand’s “why” is their “purpose, cause, or belief.” Sinek urges brands to
ask themselves, “Why does your company exist? Why do you get out of
bed in the morning? And why should anyone care?” The answer to these

How to Avoid Prison Time 141
questions has nothing to do with what you make, how much your products
or services cost, or where you’re sold. Understanding your “why” helps
guide you in maintaining authenticity and building trust with your
customers.
Many companies focus on making money and never stop to ask them-
selves why consumers would want to invest their precious time and money
into a product or service in the first place. Consumers don’t want to pay
your salary—they want to receive something of value. When they see pur-
pose behind what you do, it heightens your value and inspires them to
become a part of your world.
Brands like Apple and Nike have mastered the authentic communica-
tion of their “why.” You see it in the media related to their brands, in the
design and packaging of their products, as well as in the layout of their
stores. Each decision these companies make supports their overall brand
visions. For example, Sinek explains that Apple communicates with its cus-
tomers in a very specific fashion by basically using this philosophy:
“Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in
thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our
products beautifully designed, simple to use, and user-friendly. And we
happen to make great computers. Wanna buy one?” Apple’s clear under-
standing and communication of its “why” helps us view their products as
authentic expressions of their ideals.
Sinek adds, “Apple believed that its original Apple computer and its
Macintosh challenged the dominant IBM DOS platforms. Apple believes
its iPod and iTunes products are challenging the status quo and the music
industry. And we all understand why Apple does what it does.”
Legendary copywriter Ernest Lupinacci is a major proponent of the
notion that people “don’t buy what you make, they buy what you believe.”

142 HOOK POINT
While working for advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, Lupinacci went
to Europe to help develop a campaign for Nike’s entrance into the European
soccer market. This happened at a time when soccer was going through a
huge change—as you may know, France and England have always had a
long-standing rivalry, for various historical reasons dating back to September
of 1066 when the Battle of Hastings took place. But in 1992, to many
people’s surprise, a French superstar soccer player named Eric Cantona
became the captain of the Manchester United soccer team in England. It
was a historic event. But while Nike was already sponsoring Cantona, they
didn’t know how to leverage this fact into their marketing strategy—they
didn’t feel they had the credibility or authenticity to speak about European
soccer because they were so new to the sport. When Lupinacci talked to
Nike about how he felt they should present the brand to European soccer
fans, he explained that the company had an incredible opportunity because
of their history of being a brand that just does it. Lupinacci said, “Listen, if
Nike had been around when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the
major leagues, they would have sponsored him. That’s the kind of thing
that Nike is all about. That’s why this brand gets out of bed in the
morning.”
In the presentation to Nike, Lupinacci’s team put a Che Guevara–
inspired piece of imagery on a slide with all the great Nike footballers they’d
signed, and the statement, “Nike, Inc. Dismantling the establishment since
1971.” Then Lupinacci went on to share that the genius of the new
European soccer pillar of the brand was that not only did they have the
right to contribute to the conversation in the world of professional soccer,
but they could say things about current events that their competitors
couldn’t. The conversation wasn’t about equipment innovation—it was
actually about “a revolution in the social fabric of the sport itself.” The

How to Avoid Prison Time 143
presentation struck home and set a tone for how the team could credibly
and authentically demonstrate their point of view to the masses.
Lupinacci adds that credibility and authenticity are essential when try-
ing to attach timely events (or what he likes to refer to as “inciting inci-
dents”) to campaigns. This is important because “imagine a TV show or a
movie franchise that you love. If a character suddenly does something
strange or out of character in an episode or in a sequel, you’ll find it inau-
thentic and unsatisfying. The marketing analogy for that is every once in a
while, a brand will do an extension, or it will create a message that seems
inauthentic. Oftentimes this happens because the brand hasn’t made a link
between what they believe and what they make.”
That link, again, is why Lupinacci believes that Nike had the right to
enter the European soccer conversation: “Not because of their history in
regard to making shoes, but because of the power and continuity of their
message. Soccer may have been a new sport for Nike, but the belief sys-
tem of the brand—and how it resonates with athletes—successfully tran-
scends the various individual sports. The power of a brand isn’t rooted in
the quality of their products. The power of a brand is rooted in its own
beliefs.”
Another brand that understands its values is the For Dummies series,
which also tells a story about being unconventional and challenging the
status quo. John Kilcullen, founding member and chairman/CEO of IDG
Books Worldwide, and creator of the For Dummies book series, shares that
these works were created to provide a fun and easy reference to understand
just what you need to know about a particular subject and get on with your
life. Fans of the For Dummies series appreciated the comic relief, cartoons,
and graphic devices throughout each book that made the learning experi-
ence more engaging.

144 HOOK POINT
The “why” of challenging the status quo went into the design of each
element of the books and their marketing strategies. The series made sure
to use humor in the writing, which was also often found in the packaging
of the products themselves. For example, when the company released the
French version of Sex for Dummies, they put a condom on the inside back
cover with an arrow to text that said, “This way up.” They used this type of
respectful humor to engage people, stand out, and make the topics more
approachable. If the idea, again, had not been in line with the soul of the
brand, it would have come across as cheesy or inappropriate. But because
this marketing stunt (and truly amazing Hook Point) did mesh with the
company’s messaging, Sex for Dummies ended up becoming the most pop-
ular For Dummies title sold outside of the United States.
For help in finding your “why,” read Simon Sinek’s book Start With
Why. It will guide you as an individual or company in discovering what
makes you tick. Knowing this will be a compass that helps you develop
more authentic Hook Points and stories.
GILLETTE VS. NIKE
Knowing your “why” is imperative for coming up with Hook Points
and telling stories. If you aren’t clear about your “why,” you can actu-
ally end up offending people. Recently, Gillette got a lot of pushback
on its “We Believe” commercial that addresses “toxic masculinity,”
including sexual harassment, the #MeToo movement, and bullying.
(You can watch the commercial here: https://time.com/5503156
/gillette-razors-toxic-masculinity/.) Although the message in the ad is

How to Avoid Prison Time 145
great—of course, men and women should treat others with respect—
it also makes sense that audiences have been put off.
As a brand, Gillette had not talked about social responsibility prior
to this campaign. They’d always focused on hair removal, which is
why when they suddenly came out with an ad telling men they need
to behave differently, many consumers felt that they were trying to
insert themselves in a conversation they had no permission entering
because that’s not who they are as a company. To some in the audi-
ence, the ad came across as gratuitous and opportunistic. Again, this
is because Gillette generally talked about what it does—making razors
with five blades and lubrication that cuts hair—they’d never been a
company that told you why they made razors. So, although Gillette
did attract lots of attention from this ad, it isn’t clear whether or not
it has actually helped build new connections and affinity. Jane Zupan,
senior director of product marketing at Crimson Hexagon, believes
that the campaign helped create new connections with women, but
currently the ad has received 1.5 million dislikes and only 806,000
likes on YouTube. 
58 
Overall, I do not think the campaign has been a
huge success.
These results are in stark contrast to those occasions when Nike
takes a stand on a social issue. The company has experience in this
arena and has done an amazing job of articulating their “why” over
the years, so that’s why the brand’s controversial Colin Kaepernick
campaign, which features Kaepernick’s voice with the tagline “Believe

146 HOOK POINT
in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” was a success.
The tagline references the national-anthem protest against police bru-
tality that may have cost Kaepernick his NFL career. The ad received
mixed responses, but because Nike understood their core audience
(Gen Z and millennial demographics) who support socially active
brands, and because the ad appears to be aligned with the brand’s core
values (Nike said they would invest in those who sacrifice), the cam-
paign was well received. After this ad was released, stock prices reached
an all-time high, online sales grew by 31 percent the immediate week-
end following the release, and they received more than 450,000 men-
tions on Twitter in a single day. 
59
The difference in the results between these two campaigns is a good
lesson in making sure you choose a Hook Point that supports who
you are and why you do what you do. You can’t just go off and create
random Hook Points and stories that don’t support your underlying
foundation, because it may backfire. If, on the other hand, you choose
the right hooks—which are authentic to who you are—they can gen-
erate a lot of success.
GOOD HOOK POINTS ESTABLISH CREDIBILITY

lish credibility for new business opportunities. When he’s attending a

conference and wants to connect with panel members, he only has seconds
to grab their attention. After years of experience, he’s learned that one of
the best ways to establish immediate credibility is to use Hook Points. As
soon as a speaker walks off the stage, he will often go up to the person and
say, “Hey, that was awesome. I’d like to talk to you because we’re creating
the most successful video content in the world right now, and we can
help you tell your story better and reach more people.” The phrase in bold
is the Hook Point that establishes the credibility and gets Brownstein into
meetings. If he didn’t include the information about creating the most
successful content in the world right now, and left it at “I’d like to talk to
you . . . ,” he wouldn’t stand out. He’d be like every other person vying for
a speaker’s attention.
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, TV GREEN ROOMS,
AND A LESSON IN AUTHENTICITY
When I flew to New York to do some press interviews for my last book, I
was featured on two shows. The first was The David Webb Show, which you
can listen to here: www.brendanjkane.com/davidwebb/. After the inter-
view, Webb asked if I was taking on new clients and if I could look at his
social media presence. Although I went on his show with the sole intention
of providing value, I ended up with a potential business opportunity. This
happened because of my authentic desire to be helpful and do a good job,
in addition to the use of the strong Hook Point of generating a million
followers in 30 days (which was what got me invited on the show in the
first place).
I had a similar experience when I was on the TV show Kennedy on the
FOX Business network. While waiting in the green room, I met Democratic

148 HOOK POINT
presidential candidate John Delaney. I didn’t know who he was when we
started talking; we were just having an authentic conversation about what
I did and my viewpoint on social media, and then he asked if he could hire
me to help him with his social media campaign. Meeting people organi-
cally, providing value, and connecting with them authentically builds
enough trust and credibility to gain potential new business opportunities.
(I didn’t try to sell either John Delaney or David Webb anything, and I
certainly didn’t use a sales pitch.)
You can do this too! To build trust and credibility, start conversations
with your strongest Hook Points and most compelling stories. If you fol-
low the process I’m teaching throughout this book, it will open doors to
more opportunities. The process works! It will require practice, however, so
don’t get frustrated if it takes time to get it down. Sometimes I spend
months perfecting a hook and story before it really starts to land.
A MILLION DOLLARS AND THREE LESSONS IN FAILURE
Once you become a master at grabbing attention, you may generate more
leads than you can handle. You’ll get excited and want to say yes to every-
thing, but don’t make this mistake. I’ve found myself in situations where
I’ve taken on projects that weren’t actually the best fit. When I first started
out, my strong Hook Points and stories led to generating deals even when
I probably wasn’t the best person for the job. This is a problem because
when you land big projects and clients, you have to deliver.
Early on in my career, I raised millions of dollars for companies that
didn’t end up working out. I had a great Hook Point, told a compelling
story, found investors, and ultimately the businesses failed. They failed for
multiple reasons, but one of the main reasons is that my core expertise and

How to Avoid Prison Time 149
skill set is not to run a company as a CEO or COO. Over time I realized
that I am world class at providing strategy, clarity, innovation, and vision
for companies—not at running the day-to-day operations.
The information in this book can help you close big deals, drive a signif-
icant increase in sales, and create more effective content, but you have to
know what you’re authentically good at to truly succeed. Authenticity is
the glue that holds everything together. Although great hooks and stories
can make people lean in and pay attention, your brand or company will fall
apart if your stories don’t ring true and you can’t deliver.
Look at the scandal uncovered in the documentary The Inventor: Out for
Blood in Silicon Valley. Elizabeth Holmes, who founded the now-defunct
health-technology company Theranos, became the world’s youngest self-
made billionaire, but she couldn’t maintain her success because, well, her
product was fake. Her Hook Point made her great at finding investors and
selling—I mean, who didn’t want to believe that we could make blood
testing cheaper and easier by running multiple tests off a single drop of
blood? It would be amazing . . . if it were true. Unfortunately, Holmes was
a better storyteller than product creator.
The same can be said about the people behind the Fyre Festival. The
marketing behind this “luxury” musical event was amazing. But Billy
McFarland, CEO of Fyre Media Inc., couldn’t make it happen. Many peo-
ple believe that McFarland was a con man, but I do feel that his team’s
intention was to pull off the festival they presented in their marketing
material. I think they simply never imagined how hard it would be to orga-
nize a festival that had gained that much popularity.

150 HOOK POINT
SET CLEAR EXPECTATIONS
You can avoid the types of situations described above by being honest with
yourself. If you do so, you’ll be honest with all your clients. When I worked
with Katie Couric and the producers of Yahoo!, there was always a constant
line of dialogue about the need to optimize. I set the expectation with
Couric that we would be continually testing a plethora of interviews. Very
early on I cautioned, “Don’t fall in love with any one interview. If an inter-
view doesn’t work, it’s fine. We’ll learn something from it and keep adjust-
ing it until we find the interviews that go viral.”
I set this expectation up front because it was the most realistic scenario.
By speaking to Couric ahead of time, I kept us on the same page. From the
beginning, we recognized that failure would be a part of the process.
WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU CAN’T DELIVER
In the Netflix documentary Fyre, you can see that even after the festival fell
apart, McFarland didn’t learn from his mistakes. In fact, while he was being
sued, he created another scam around selling exclusive tickets for backstage
passes to concerts he didn’t have access to. We all make mistakes, of
course—no one’s perfect all the time—but you should try to learn from
your experiences. Analyze which behaviors and strategies work and which
don’t so you can own your limitations, grow, move forward, and better set
yourself up for success the next time around.
If, for whatever reason, you find yourself in a situation where you can’t
deliver, be open and communicate this fact to the client. The worst thing
you can do is disappear. Get on the phone and explain why there are delays
or setbacks. As difficult as this conversation may be, it’s more effective than
simply ignoring the fact that things aren’t going as planned. Most people

How to Avoid Prison Time 151
really appreciate and respect communication. If you try to hide problems
and avoid communicating when things aren’t going well, you’ll most likely
end up losing the client. And if that happens several times, you’ll end up
with a bad reputation. Instead, be honest and up front about what’s going
on, how you’re trying to fix the situation, or even about needing to let the
client go. Without a doubt, being honest will lead to better results in the
long run.
THE POWER OF NO
When I decide to work with someone, I do so because I see an interesting
and exciting opportunity. It’s not that I go into meetings thinking, Oh, this
is a turning point in my career. This is a huge meeting. I’m going to make a lot
of money. Rather, I go in thinking, I’m excited about this. I want to share this
information with people. I feel that this Hook Point and story will deliver value
to the person on the other side of the table. If I don’t feel that way, I turn the
meeting or project down.
I believe that this mindset is critically important for success. If you’re not
authentically excited about what you’re doing, it will show, which is why I
never create a Hook Point or story about anything that doesn’t excite me.
I build trust and credibility in rooms with very high-profile people quickly
because they can see my authentic passion for their projects. Again, if I
don’t believe in it, I don’t do it.
Saying no to projects you don’t believe in works in your favor. One time
I had dinner with Hush, one of the top street artists in the world. Hush
told me that he only creates a select number of high-end pieces a year and
that he sells his work for tens of thousands of dollars because of that fact.
When I asked him how he built demand for his work, he said that it was

152 HOOK POINT
“by exercising the power of no.” Oftentimes he’ll get commissioned by
groups or people who want his work, but if he isn’t truly passionate about
the project, he’ll turn it down. He’s found that the exclusivity of his work
has created a higher demand.
So don’t say yes to every opportunity. Only take on work that truly
speaks to you. Doing so can increase your value.
“FAILING” IN LOVE WITH SUCCESS
To attain success in sales, you need to build relationships filled with trust.
Your consumers, or potential partners, must believe that you’ll deliver on
your promise or they won’t give you their money. And you should be build-
ing a good rapport even when people don’t choose to work with you or
purchase from you right away. You never know when potential consumers
will change their minds, or when a new opportunity will appear that leads
to your working together years down the road.
One time one of my colleagues failed in a meeting with an important
client because he didn’t do his homework to understand the company’s
needs. He pitched a service the company didn’t want and realized immedi-
ately that the meeting hadn’t gone well. Afterward, he took responsibility
and apologized to the person who’d set up the meeting and who also hap-
pened to be in the room. My colleague was humble enough to admit that
he’d messed up. Taking responsibility in this moment was the best choice
he could have made. It helped him maintain his credibility with the person
who’d set up the meeting, which turned out to be incredibly fruitful.
When you’re young, you want everything to happen right away. But
with experience you realize that you may have a conversation today that

How to Avoid Prison Time 153
will lead to a company you create down the line. Don’t be impatient and
destroy future opportunities—always play the long game.
Also, when trying to close big deals, you have to be passionate and
knowledgeable about the products or services you’re selling. Know them
inside and out so you can answer questions confidently, address your tar-
get’s pain points, and eliminate doubts or concerns about the validity of
your business.
However, in cases where you don’t know the answer to a question, don’t
make up details to fill in the blanks. It’s better to admit that you don’t
know, and tell clients that you’ll get back to them when you have more
answers. Remember, authenticity helps you maintain trust and credibility.
HOW TO CREATE GENUINE TRUST IN MEETINGS
In the article “How to Get People to Like You: 7 Ways From an FBI
Behavior Expert” (a solid Hook Point for an article title, by the way),
Eric Barker explains how to build rapport and create trust. He inter-
viewed Robin K. Dreeke, the head of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis
Program, who’s studied interpersonal relations for more than 27 years.
Dreeke’s number-one piece of advice is to “seek someone else’s
thoughts and opinions without judging them.” You don’t have to
agree with them, but you need to validate others by taking time to
understand their dreams, desires, and needs.
Here’s the full list of Dreeke’s seven best ways to build trust and
credibility:

154 HOOK POINT
1. Nonjudgmental validation. Seek the other person’s
opinions and thoughts without judging them.
2. Focus on the other person.
3. Listen with your full presence. Ask questions and
actually hear the answers.
4. Ask the other person about their challenges.
5. Establish a time constraint early in the conversation.
This puts strangers at ease.
6. Smile, and keep your palms open and facing up.
7. If you feel manipulated, clarify your goals. Don’t get
aggressive. Simply ask the other person to be honest
about what they want.
60
Some additional resources that can help you build trust and credi-
bility with others include Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and
Influence People and Marshall Rosenberg’s Nonviolent Communication:
A Language of Life. Both books teach you how to communicate effec-
tively with others, and how to better understand their needs so you
can build more trust and credibility.

AUTHENTICITY IN CONTENT CREATION:
WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN?
Authenticity helps establish trust with your audience and plays a huge fac-
tor in achieving success on digital platforms. Digital content strategist
Naveen Gowda shares that most people are well accustomed to the tricks
and practices of advertisers, which is why a lot of brands struggle to get
meaningful engagement on social media. Rather than thinking about who
they are and what they want to say, brands should be thinking about the
needs of their viewers.
Stand-up comedian Joe Rogan has tremendous success in the 3-second
world. He gets people to tune in to his channels for hours because he deliv-
ers strong content and makes no compromises on his quality standards.
Gowda believes that although it may take longer, it’s worth your time to
establish a brand that is powerful and trustworthy—eventually, it helps you
capture longer amounts of viewer time.
When you consistently create meaningful, quality content, you have a
better chance of truly connecting with your audience and earning trust in
our micro-attention world. Audiences will continue to watch your content
for longer periods of time so they can receive the value it provides. Whereas,
if you take shortcuts and post material just to keep up with metrics or
timetables, the quality will suffer and you’ll lose your audience’s (and the
algorithm’s) trust. If you post a few bad videos in a row, the next video you
post won’t perform as well (regardless of how good it is). To avoid this sce-
nario, Gowda often spends two or three times longer on research, ideation,
and execution to create a single video than most other content creators
would. He does this because he knows that if he gets it right, the video will
perform 10 to 100 times better than it would otherwise.

156 HOOK POINT
Posting content is like showing up for a job. Simply showing up isn’t
enough. While there, you need to work hard, do the assigned tasks, and
communicate effectively to maintain your clients’ or bosses’ trust. If, when
you show up, you slack off or fail to fulfill the role you’ve been given for a
few days, the trust will deteriorate. Gowda adds that with each video or
piece of digital content, you should not only aim to do a good job, but to
blow people away.
THE UNPOPULAR TRUTH ABOUT PRODUCTION VALUE
When viewers see highly polished and pristine content with fast cuts and
fancy effects, they automatically assume they’re watching ads. Gowda
explains that when creating videos, you should try to be as real as possible.
Production value doesn’t dictate success on social platforms; success comes
from telling an authentic and compelling story. For many of you, this is
very good news. You could potentially shoot a video on your smartphone
and reach millions of people with essentially no budget.
Quick Tips and Recap
1. Authenticity helps your Hook Points stick, and without it, they
fall flat.
2. Let your “why” be a guide to building trust and authenticity
with your consumers.
3. “People don’t buy what you make, they buy what you believe.”
—Ernest Lupinacci
4. If your Hook Points don’t support your underlying foundation,
they can backfire.

5. Use Hook Points to quickly establish credibility with new
businesses.
6. Be honest with yourself and your clients by setting clear expec-
tations about what you can and cannot deliver.
7. Only take on work that truly speaks to you. Sometimes saying
no can create more demand.
8. Success in sales comes from building trust-filled relationships.
9. Don’t be impatient and destroy future opportunities—always
play the long game, because important opportunities may come
down the line.
10. Listen to your clients so you can truly understand their needs.

CHAPTER 6
LEARN TO LISTEN;
LISTEN TO LEARN
Businessman and investor Mark Cuban, who owns the NBA’s Dallas
Mavericks and is one of the main investors in ABC’s Shark Tank, worked at
a company called Tronics 2000 right out of college. While there, a man
named Larry Menaw gave him some of the best advice he’s ever received.
Menaw noticed that Cuban was hyper and always on the go. One day
before one of their meetings started, Menaw gave Cuban some specific
instructions: “Mark, I want you to do one thing for me. Whenever we sit
down for a meeting, I want you to take out your pad of paper and pen, and
in the upper right-hand corner, write down the word listen.” To this day,
Cuban follows that advice. He writes down the word listen before every
meeting to remind himself to be quiet and hear what the other people in
the room have to say.

160 HOOK POINT
THE GOLD MINE THAT LIES BETWEEN YOUR EARS
Listening is essential in our 3-second world. We have an incredible amount
of information coming at us, so it’s easy to become distracted, but focusing
and staying present—especially when clients or partners speak—ultimately
helps you discover your best Hook Points. When you listen to potential
customers carefully, you’re more likely to discover their pain points and
learn where your skills, products, and services meet their needs.
Taking the time to truly listen can provide you with a gold mine of
information that helps you become more valuable. If you ask the right
questions, you’ll be at an advantage in how you choose to present your
products and services. And in meetings, you’ll be better equipped to quickly
shape your Hook Points and stories to become the solution to your poten-
tial customers’ problems.
The Sleep Doctor, Michael Breus, reveals that he’s absolutely discovered
some of his most valuable Hook Points by listening. He’s been asked a lot
of questions by patients and audience members at the speeches he gives,
which have helped him discover the most common pain points around
which to create Hook Points and stories. Listening has helped him better
frame his messages to show people how he can provide solutions to their
most common sleep-related problems.
HOOKS FOR DUMMIES
I mentioned John Kilcullen earlier—the creator of the highly successful For
Dummies book series. He agrees that a key for success in business is listen-
ing to qualified prospects and customers. It’s the exact reason why Kilcullen
reads many of the feedback cards inside of every For Dummies book. When
his team released Quicken for Dummies, many readers had one common

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 161
piece of feedback—they wanted a book that would teach them how to
manage their money. Receiving this feedback was a defining moment for
the brand. It helped Kilcullen and his team realize that they could extend
beyond books created for the information-technology industry and release
books on personal finance as well.
By listening to their clients’ needs, Kilcullen’s team expanded a book
series about information technology into a brand that covers thousands of
topics. Had Kilcullen not listened to his clients’ feedback, the brand may
not have generated around 2,500 titles with more than 200 million books
in print.
Ernest Lupinacci agrees that successful brand extensions can be created
by listening to customers. The evolution of the content created by Life
magazine is a testament to this fact. The most popular section in Life was
the “People” section, so, in response, the Meredith Corporation created
People magazine. Then, the most popular section in People magazine was
the “Style” section; hence, the creation of InStyle magazine. After that, they
noticed that the most popular section in InStyle was the wedding section;
therefore, InStyle Weddings was born. And last (but certainly not least), the
most popular section in InStyle Weddings was the celebrity section, so
InStyle: Celebrity Weddings was created.
Ask for your customers’ feedback, take it seriously. You never know,
someone might give you a multimillion-dollar idea. But you’ll only hear
about it if you’re asking the right questions (and listening).
TRAINING YOUR EAR TO BE SWIFT
When I talk about listening in person, I’m referring to active listening. This
is where you read between the lines and start to truly understand what the

162 HOOK POINT
person in front of you is saying. It helps you stay present and read people
accurately. The information you gather from this practice helps you become
more finessed in your delivery of products and services. You start to under-
stand that even if you’re talking to three people at the same company—
perhaps a CEO, a VP, and a middle manager—you still need to tweak your
Hook Points and stories to address the nuanced pain points of each of these
parties.
For example, as I touched on earlier in this book, before meeting Taylor
Swift, I had to go through a series of meetings to get the opportunity to
work with her. I had a licensing deal with MTV, and it was through that
connection that I was offered the opportunity to meet her. At the time, I
didn’t know who Taylor Swift was (because she was just on her way to
superstardom), which seems bizarre now, but luckily, as it was early on in
my career, I was up for meeting with anyone.
My first meeting was with Swift’s record label. Then I had separate meet-
ings with her father, mother, and then finally with Swift. My ability to
meet with and listen to each of these people is what ultimately helped me
secure the deal. In each interaction, I learned how Swift and her team per-
ceived the world. It enabled me to highlight different aspects of my story
to satisfy each party’s needs to pass on to the next round.
This process gave me a lot of time to ask questions and to start to truly
understand what Swift wanted. I took this information to craft the most
compelling Hook Points and stories specific to her needs. I learned that
Swift had built her brand herself by fostering a one-to-one connection with
her fans. She constantly communicated with them by responding to com-
ments, signing autographs, and taking photos with them. She’d started her
internet presence and fan out-reach through Myspace, which she loved
because she could control the design of her page with embedded codes.

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 163
Now it was time to expand beyond Myspace. She’d spent a fortune on
an all-flash website that took two days to update—with the help of a devel-
oper. Swift didn’t like that she couldn’t control the website herself. With the
feedback I received from Swift and her family, my team built her an entirely
new website in fewer than six hours.
In the meeting, the story I told was, “Taylor, I know you love interacting
with your fans and controlling your brand design. We understand that
your pain point with your website is that you can’t change anything your-
self, so we built this system for people like you. You can go in and change
any element of this website yourself without having to write code.” During
the meeting, I also showed her how we could launch new pages and change
out the navigation, photos, and backdrop of the entire site to match her
latest album in fewer than two seconds. I gave her the mouse during the
meeting so she could move things around and revise the site on the spot
herself.
In the meetings with Swift’s record label, father, and mother, I went in
with slightly different variations of the story that specifically served their
needs, questions, and concerns. I highlighted the business aspect of the
story to the record label and Swift’s father, and made Swift’s mother feel
comfortable about trusting my team. I had to listen to what each of them
wanted in order to provide each person on her team with value. Whereas,
if I simply went in and pitched my ideas to Swift directly, I may have pre-
sented them in a way that wouldn’t have met her needs as thoroughly.
The latter is what most people do—they go into meetings, talk a lot,
give a presentation, and pitch whatever they’re trying to sell. This happens
with digital content as well—people generally focus on what they want to
say, not on what their audience wants to hear. When I go into a room, most
times I don’t even bring a presentation. I hardly use demos or PowerPoints

164 HOOK POINT
anymore because they put you in a position where you can’t modify your
message to the responses you receive.
Imagine you go into a meeting and find out that the person you’re speak-
ing to perceives the situation in a different manner than you anticipated.
Or perhaps this person sees the situation differently than someone else
within the same company (whom you’ll also ultimately have to convince to
get the job or sell the product). You could meet with the CEO, who says,
“Yes, we love this, but you’ve got to meet with the VP of marketing because
she makes the decisions about this specific service.” If that happens, you
can’t go in and use the exact same talking points as with the CEO—the VP
of marketing probably perceives the solutions, pain points, and needs
differently—she has distinct roles and responsibilities that alter her percep-
tion about what is needed and of value. You need to keep what the CEO
said in mind, and also ask the VP of marketing questions to understand
what she deems important. Then you can craft your story to help her better
see your value.
HOW TO WIN THE GOLD RUSH:
THE ART OF ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS
Don’t make assumptions or go into meetings with a preconceived idea or
pitch, even when you’ve already met with others at the company. Take a
step back, ask questions, and truly listen to what these people have to say.
Take the time to understand those on the other side of the table, and how
they perceive their problems. Observe their body language, moods, and
responses. All of these variables dictate how you package your information
so you can better connect with potential clients, partners, and employers.

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 165
Don’t guess, assuming you know what they want. Use their responses and
feedback to craft your stories.
I practice my stories over and over again with different people so that I
get really good at telling them. Then, once I’m in the room, I let the other
person inform how I change my Hook Point or story. I prepare for meet-
ings by establishing a Hook Point, such as my “Zero to a Million Followers
in 30 Days” concept, and then I practice the story with business partners
whose opinions I trust.
I conduct this initial practice not only to get better at communicating
my Hook Points and stories, but also to get feedback to see if they’re work-
ing. If you do this, by the time you walk into a meeting, you’ll have prac-
ticed your Hook Point and story so many times that you can just sit back,
listen, and alter your story based on the other person’s response.
Enter the room with practiced Hook Points and stories that can be fluid.
Get as comfortable as you can with all the information so you can change
how you tell your story. Become confident enough to tell it in a different
order, leaving out certain parts or adding information in, so you can share
what best meets your potential clients’ needs. And pay attention to any
questions they ask you so that you understand what they deem valuable.
Jim Kane, my father, and former partner of one of the oldest law firms
in Chicago (with offices all over the US), agrees that doing research and
having background knowledge about a potential client and their needs is
critical. Before taking meetings, the marketing department at his firm
would conduct research about a potential client’s business to see which
attorney had the most expertise in the space. Then they would go in with
as much preparation as possible so they could let the meeting take on a life
of its own.

166 HOOK POINT
Aside from addressing the areas of expertise that a potential client is
looking for, my dad says that “the most important thing a really good law-
yer can do is to listen to the client’s response to the presentation.” The best
lawyers he saw in all his years of practice were the ones who listened and
adjusted on the fly to address what potential clients needed.
You can give the best presentation in the world, but it won’t secure new
business if what you offer doesn’t address what clients want. Listen very
carefully, and be ready to change your approach. My father adds that often-
times potential clients don’t know what they need until they’re asked the
right questions.
A Question a Day Keeps the Pain Away
Below are some general questions you can ask when entering a meeting.
You’ll need to get much more specific based on your industry and potential
customers’ needs, but these questions offer good starting points:
1. What are your most important goals and objectives?
2. What obstacles are you running into while trying to achieve
those goals?
3. What are the pain points that are most frustrating for your
organization?
4. What are the biggest pain points you’re experiencing in your
specific position?
Again, these are very high-level questions, but the answers can help
you learn a tremendous amount about your potential clients and their
businesses—you will discover their most important obstacles and goals.

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 167
I may meet clients who want to lower their cost of acquisition but are
struggling to make it happen. And now, because the money spent on paid
social media advertising isn’t bringing in a return, their executive team
doesn’t understand the value of paid media. With that information, I can go
in and say, “If I run a test that brings down your cost per acquisition, would
that be helpful for telling a compelling story to the higher-ups? Could it
potentially get you more of a budget to do your job more effectively?”
Essentially, you take the input they’re giving you and respond by asking,
“If I were able to solve your problem, would it be helpful . . . ?” It’s very
hard for people to say no to someone who wants to help solve a difficult
problem for them. But you can only come up with solutions to your poten-
tial clients’ problems by asking the right questions and listening. Choosing
not to do so forces you to guess, and throw out solutions without really
understanding how they perceive the situation (which isn’t a good strategy
for securing new clients).
SHUT UP! YOU’LL SCARE THE FISH AWAY
A friend of mine told me that American business magnate, producer, and
film-studio executive David Geffen is always the quietest person in the
room. He doesn’t talk much, but when he has something to say, everyone
stops and listens.
I’ve noticed this trend among some of the most impressive and powerful
people I’ve encountered. They don’t have the need to speak unless they
have something important to say, and they often take the time to think
it through before they say it. I distinctly remember when I had my first
meeting with Tom Rosenberg, founder and chairman of Lakeshore
Entertainment. My father knew that he was an intelligent man and gave

168 HOOK POINT
me a heads-up that he would have a unique communication style. He told
me, “When you go into that meeting with Rosenberg, he may take some
very long pauses—it’s because he’s thinking about what he’s going to say
next or he’s digesting the information.” My dad was right. Rosenberg is one
of those people who is very vocal when necessary, but many times there’s a
bit of an uncomfortable silence that leaves you wondering if you were sup-
posed to say something. I quickly learned that this was just his way of lis-
tening and processing information.
PRACTICE THE TANGO IN MEETINGS
Keith Ferrazzi, author of the New York Times bestselling books Never
Eat Alone and Who’s Got Your Back, and founder and CEO of Ferrazzi
Greenlight, says that listening is helpful because anytime you want to bring
your best self to a situation, you need to care as much as you can about the
other people in the meeting. He thinks it’s important that others feel like
you truly want to make a difference in their lives.
One tool Ferrazzi shares to help you develop a deeper connection with the
people you’re going to listen to is an imagination exercise. Visualize the per-
son you’re about to have a meeting with five years from now. Imagine that at
this time he’s one of the most important people in your life. If you take the
time to see all the ways in which you can help him become successful, then
you’ll walk into the room with a huge smile and, as Ferrazzi says, “you will
create a level of intimacy, connectedness, expectation, and possibility. An
authentic, fruitful feeling that this person is part of your ‘posse.’ If you walk
into the room with that energy, you will win.” He adds that you should see
every interaction as a co-creation. Don’t ever go in trying to sell your idea. Go
into meetings thinking you’re doing the tango. He says, “Sometimes you’re

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 169
dancing forward, and sometimes you’re dancing backward, but ultimately it’s
an interaction that will yield transformational results. As long as you bring
power, energy, and attention, the meeting will go well.”
LISTEN TO EXPERTS WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU
Billionaire Ray Dalio manages $150 billion in global investments and runs
Bridgewater Associates. He shares that one of the strategies that has helped
him become rich and successful is listening to smart people who disagree
with him. Dalio likes to question experts individually and encourages them
to have thoughtful disagreement with each other so he can become better
educated and raise his “probability of being right.” He doesn’t like to assume
he’s right until he has spoken to many independent thinkers. He advises
seeking out “the smartest people who disagree with you the most to stress
test your thinking. If they disagree, then the conversation in that disagree-
ment will be enlightening. [It’s] the quickest way to get an education.”

RECEPTIVITY IS CREATIVITY
Ernest Lupinacci shared that one of his mentors, Tom Carroll (the former
CEO of TBWA Worldwide), told him that Lee Clow (the chairman and
global director of TBWA) always emphasized that “creativity is receptivity.”
Creativity is enhanced by the ability to entertain someone else’s idea and
give it a chance. Lupinacci values listening to others and gets frustrated

170 HOOK POINT
when he sees people with narrow-minded points of views or those who are
constantly playing the contrarian. For example, he might be in a meeting
giving a presentation and use an example like, “Well, you know it’s similar
to how when you drink coffee . . . ,” and then someone interrupts and says,
“I don’t drink coffee.” Or perhaps he’s saying, “You know, like in Stranger
Things, when . . . ,” and someone will say, “I’ve never seen it.” Just because
this one person doesn’t drink coffee and hasn’t seen one of the most watched
shows on Netflix doesn’t make the references obsolete. The person could
continue to listen and remain receptive to the larger ideas these details are
trying to illustrate even though it doesn’t specifically appeal to him or her.
Lupinacci says that the smartest people are aware that they’re not the one-
and-only consumers out there. They think, It doesn’t matter that I personally
don’t like coffee, or that I’ve personally never seen the show; I’m going to con-
tinue to listen so I can grasp the bigger concept.
WELCOME TO THE FBI—NOW SHUT UP AND LISTEN
Chris Voss, the former head of FBI international hostage negotiation,
explains that active listening is critical in business negotiations. Here are
the basics:
1. Listen to what the other person has to say. Don’t interrupt, dis-
agree or “evaluate.”
2. Make brief acknowledgments by saying “Yes,” “Uh-huh,” and
nodding your head.
3. Repeat back what the other person says, without being awk-
ward, so you can show that you understand their frame of
reference.

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 171
4. Ask questions to show that you’re paying attention and that help
move the discussion forward.
63
I recommend practicing active listening for a week. As you do so, follow
the steps below, and keep a journal of your observations:
• Make a point to actively listen to and observe the people
around you.
• Try to listen 90 percent of the time.
• Notice how many people around you are truly listening versus
how many are simply waiting for their turn to talk.
• Practice staying neutral. Don’t react emotionally to other peo-
ple’s responses. Try to understand the other person’s point of
view (even if you strongly disagree with it).
• Ask thoughtful questions.
• Note how people respond to being asked questions. Do they
seem open and excited that you’re taking an interest in them?
If you practice active listening and do the exercise above, you’ll be amazed
by what you discover. Not only will you realize how many people don’t take
the time to truly listen, but you’ll also be surprised by how much more
connected you feel to others. You create strong connections by simply
focusing your attention on other people instead of trying to explain your
personal points of view. If you practice this often and maintain a high level
of listening in meetings, you’ll have a better chance of winning new
business.

LEARN TO READ MINDS LIKE AN ATHLETIC TRAINER
Peter Park is the owner of Platinum Fitness and the author of Rebound:
Regain Strength, Move Effortlessly, Live without Limit—At Any Age. His cli-
ents include billionaires, celebrities, and athletes such as cyclist Lance
Armstrong, six-time Major League Baseball All-Star Justin Verlander, and
entrepreneur Elon Musk.
Park began his career working as a physical therapy aide at St. Francis
Hospital in Santa Barbara. A shy young man, Park was nervous about get-
ting people out of bed to do physical therapy exercises. Many of his patients
were disagreeable because they had serious conditions and were in a lot of
pain. In fact, some of them would yell and spit at Park.
The job forced Park to get out of his comfort zone. He talked to people
from all types of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds who perceived the
world in many different ways. Over time, he learned how to read all these
different types of people and started to better understand body language
and behavior, which is especially important when dealing with those who
are vulnerable and stressed.
Park went from being from a shy, reserved guy to a person who could
interact with anyone. By the time he became a personal trainer, his clients
felt like a breeze—for starters, they weren’t in as much pain and usually had
the desire to work out. And most important, the experience at the hospital
made him a fantastic listener, which has been a major factor in his ability
to secure and maintain high-level clients.
Use each job you have to become more understanding of others. You
never know where the knowledge will take you. Listening to and observing
others will make you a better businessperson all around.

SURVIVING SIRIUSXM AND BARRY DILLER,
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MEDITATION
One time I had a meeting with Sirius XM that went horribly wrong. It all
started because the company wanted help driving traffic to a new platform
they were building. Initially, I had a great conversation with a high-level
executive, so they set up a meeting with the developer who was working on
the platform.
Unfortunately, the developer wasn’t open to hearing how social media
presence and advertising could drive traffic to the website. He didn’t see the
value in what I had to offer and didn’t want to invest in it. I kept trying to
explain how social media works, how it drives traffic, and how it can pro-
vide value—but he kept cutting me off and wouldn’t listen.
Eventually, I got up and said, “Well, I can’t help you, then. I don’t know
what you want me to do,” and left the room in frustration. I lost the deal
because of my decision, which was disappointing. Although I don’t think
we would have worked well together, I could have handled the situation
better. I should’ve taken a deep breath and worked harder to understand
the developer’s point of view. I could have been less reactive, and grateful
for the meeting, instead of just walking out.
Looking back, I realize that I was very stressed out at the time this hap-
pened—I wasn’t living as healthy of a life as I am now. When you’re stressed
and tired, you don’t think clearly or handle situations like you would when
you’re taking good care of yourself. That’s one of the reasons why I practice
meditation. It’s a tool that keeps me balanced and makes me a better lis-
tener. It’s especially helpful because it slows down the mind and increases
awareness, which are useful skills for interviews, meetings, giving speeches,
and so on. If you practice meditation regularly, even for just ten minutes a
day, you’ll have a greater chance of staying present at important events.

174 HOOK POINT
You’ll also get better at absorbing the information that matters most and
remaining calm, regardless of the situation.
Keith Ferrazzi agrees. One time he met with Barry Diller, the creator of
the Fox broadcasting company and USA broadcasting, who is now the
chairman and senior executive of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Group.
Ferrazzi was on the elevator with Diller and became so nervous that he
started seeing spots in his eyes. He was very intimidated to meet this media
icon. To help himself calm down, Ferrazzi got off the elevator, went into a
phone booth, and meditated until the spots in his eyes disappeared. Then
he was able to go in and have a productive meeting with Diller.
If you find yourself experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety before big
meetings or events, there’s a self-hypnosis audio I recommend (created by
Steven Gurgevich) called Hypnotic Rehearsal. Gurgevich has created a num-
ber of self-hypnosis recordings, ranging from 15 to 20 minutes, which
cover a variety of topics. Essentially, they’re guided meditations where he
takes you through the process of rehearsing a meeting and visualizing your-
self feeling comfortable in that space. The self-hypnosis guided recording
tricks your subconscious into believing you’re entering a comfortable
situation.
Bringing your best self into a room helps you listen. If you’re distracted
by anxiety, or are tired from a poor night’s sleep, you won’t offer your full
value. Take care of yourself so you can take care of your clients (which is
ultimately another form of taking care of yourself!).

IT’S NOT A FOLLOWER—IT’S A LIVING,
BREATHING HUMAN BEING
Shift your thinking from “I’m here to sell or promote my product or ser-
vice” to “I’m here to deliver value.” If you create content without thinking
about your audience’s desires and needs, you won’t succeed. You must
know who they are, what they want, and how you can provide them
with value.
Naveen Gowda adds that your goal is not only to understand the cate-
gorical or topical needs of the audience, but also to understand what the
audience needs in terms of content behavior. For example, if a woman is
really into coffee without sugar because she believes in living a healthy life-
style, and you’re creating content to reach people like her—be aware of not
only her coffee-drinking preferences but also the other lifestyle choices
people in her demographic make—and even more important, her expecta-
tion for how communication in this category typically appears in her social
feed. For example, if she’s an average user with healthy lifestyle interests,
she will have seen the Facebook page “Goodful.” Their videos deliver great
ideas for people with very limited downtime—they get to the point really
quickly and offer value consistently without it coming off as marketing to
the audience. Users receive a holistic experience, and she’s probably hungry
for that type of content design.
Doing your research is vital. Many observations and inferences can be
made from reviewing the content your desired audience is currently watch-
ing. Ignoring those clues is the main way Gowda sees content creators fail.
Instead of taking the time to make inferences, they try to force their style
into the content, or ignore the ecosystem of content altogether.
Try not to make this mistake. If you pay attention and do research,
social media can help you succeed—it’s a tool that gives you access to a

176 HOOK POINT
massive amount of people and data at once. As discussed in chapter 3, you
can carefully review the analytics of your videos (and other people’s videos)
to help you better understand your audience’s taste. Through conducting a
competitive analysis, you can find out why content creators, who reach the
people you’d like to, perform well. Analyze videos that generate 10,000
shares versus the ones that generate only 100 shares. Through this investi-
gation, you’ll learn a wealth of helpful information. You’ll better under-
stand the topics your audience is interested in, their needs, the content
styles they’re gravitating toward, and their pain points.
For research on Facebook, Instagram,
YouTube, or Tubular, I advise typing in
relevant keywords related to your brand
and then searching for which videos have
the most views. Dive further into your
investigation around the videos that are
generating organic reach, and not solely
performing well because of advertising
dollars. For example, on Facebook you can
figure this out by looking at how many
shares a video has received versus how
many views it’s received—typically a
strong view-to-share ratio for a video with
millions of views is around 1 percent.
Here’s an example of a video with a strong
view-to-share ratio:

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 177
This video has 53 million views and 1.5 million shares, which proves
that the video generated organic views. If the video had received only thou-
sands of shares and the ratio were lower, I would assume the views were
generated through paid advertising, or perhaps they were generated from
being cross-posted on another Facebook page with a large following. The
more shares a video has generally means the video concept is stronger and
more palpable for audiences. Once you find the videos that are being
shared the most, dissect why they’re performing well. Ask yourself, “What
is it about this content and the way they positioned it that works?”
You can also use Google Trends, Reddit, and Google News to do research
about the topics and content styles people are searching for and are inter-
ested in. After you have a sense of these topics and styles, see if you can
craft Hook Points and stories that connect trends with your products or
services. Again, if you take the time to do this research, you’ll be light-years
ahead of those who come up with content ideas from scratch.
When Katie Couric was interviewing celebrities such as DJ Khaled, we
would go to Google Trends, as well as Facebook and Instagram, to see
which content was trending about him. These searches allowed us to
see how other people were positioning headlines and content about Khaled.
It gave us clues as to what worked and what didn’t, so we could come up
with stronger Hook Points. We reviewed the social media posts that were
shared at the highest velocity to give us information about Khaled’s audi-
ence’s interests. This research saved us a huge amount of time.
The trending topics you find to inspire your stories don’t have to be
directly related to your brand. You can connect your product or service to
popular topics even if they’re seemingly unrelated. It’s just a matter of being
smart about how you make them relatable.

178 HOOK POINT
A successful case of creating content based on a trending topic, which
wasn’t the brand itself, is Shareability’s video campaign for Pizza Hut and
Pepsi called “The Dangers of Selfie Sticks.” The video is in the form of a
goof public-service announcement about the dangers of using selfie sticks.
Brownstein’s team got the idea from the fact that selfie sticks were a trend-
ing topic because they’d just been banned from Disneyland. Pizza Hut was
in the process of launching a two-foot-long pizza, so they came up with the
concept that you would need a really long selfie stick to take a photo with
this new, unusually long pizza. By making that connection in a funny way,
and creating a parody of selfies in general, the video went viral on YouTube.
It became the most shared ad in the world the month it launched partly
due to the relevance of “selfie sticks” in video search at the time.
Digital content strategist Naveen Gowda reminds us that the more you
study communication design and consume great content, the better
equipped you’ll be to create relevant content. You need to listen to the
other content creators in your space and become a consumer of the types
of content that reach your audience.
Quick Tips and Recap
1. Listening can help you discover Hook Points, stories, and prod-
ucts that provide solutions to your potential customers’ most
common problems.
2. Ask a lot of questions to figure out what your potential clients
truly need. Don’t guess, assuming that you know what they want.
3. Don’t pitch. Be flexible in how you present your stories, prod-
ucts, and services.

Learn to Listen; Listen to Learn 179
4. Practice your Hook Points and stories with trusted business
partners, and measure how they respond.
5. Remember that creativity is enhanced by the ability to listen and
entertain other people’s ideas.
6. Be cognizant of the fact that active listening helps you win new
business.
7. Create content with your audience’s desires and needs in mind.
Shift your mindset from “I’m here to sell or promote my prod-
uct or service” to “I’m here to deliver value with my product or
service.”
8. Use Google News, Google Trends, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram,
Tubular, and Facebook to research the topics and content styles
that people are searching for and are interested in.
9. Frequently conduct a competitive analysis on trending social
media content formats and concepts to save time and create bet-
ter content.



CHAPTER 7
TAKE EVERYTHING I HAVE—
IT’S YOURS FOR FREE:
HOW TO ACCELERATE DEMAND
FOR YOUR BRAND
Value is at the core of every successful business. If a product or service
doesn’t provide value, it shouldn’t exist, which is why knowing how to
demonstrate value is an essential part of the Hook Point and storytelling
process. If you can highlight and package a message properly, you’ll capture
attention, get into more rooms for interviews, and perform like a rock star
in meetings. You’ll also have a greater chance of creating more effective
content that drives massive reach, and convincing prospects to respond to
cold outreach emails.
BREAK THE BOX TO DRIVE DEMAND
Value should be inherent in whatever you’re marketing, and oftentimes it’s
the out-of-the-box concepts related to your product or service that drive

182 HOOK POINT
the differentiation of your brand against competitors. These unique bene-
fits are not always necessary for your products to function, but they help
you stand out, offer something unique, and can become one of the Hook
Points that drives massive brand growth. Let’s look at some examples of
out-of-the-box value that was leveraged for effective Hook Points:
Lady Gaga: The Mother Monster and the LGBTQ Community
For more than a decade, Lady Gaga has leveraged out-of-the-box thinking
to truly stand out and become a global superstar. For example, she has
advocated for the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
or questioning) community and has shown her support in truly original
ways. In 2009, when she received an award for the song “Poker Face” at
Canada’s iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards, she gave thanks “to God
and the gays” in her acceptance speech. This may seem like a simple state-
ment, but it was fresh and original in comparison with most speeches of
this kind.
Gaga has participated in the National Equality March and the Human
Rights Campaign gala, and has protested the military’s anti-LGBTQ policy
(with her infamous meat dress) to prove her loyalty to this group. 
64 
Under
the moniker “Mother Monster,” she’s positioned herself to all her “little
monsters,” aka fans. She says that the term little monsters originated from
her fear of death, alcohol, and drugs, but it’s been a perfect marketing
tool to appeal to the outcasts, misfits, LGBTQ community, and other

marginalized groups. Her communication with her fan base is original and
(in some ways) revolutionary.
Gaga has advocated for being different and standing out. She’s empow-
ered her fans and has provided them with the tremendous value of feeling
strong enough to stand up for who they are. She’s built her brand by con-
necting with people in these groups—she makes them feel like they have
someone (in her) who understands and creates music for them.
Helipad at Platinum Fitness
Currently I’m working with Peter Park, the personal trainer and owner of
Platinum Fitness, who, as previously mentioned, has trained clients such as
Lance Armstrong and Elon Musk. Although he’s worked with major celeb-
rities and athletes and often leverages that fact as his Hook Point, he’s con-
stantly testing new ways to grab people’s attention.
One aspect of Park’s Los Angeles–based gym that we’ve discussed high-
lighting through social channels is the helipad on top of the building where
his gym resides. Park has access to the helipad and has used it in his train-
ing sessions and classes. It’s a unique, differentiating element of his business
because there are very few gyms in the world that have a helipad that you
can work out on. We’ll take videos and pictures of people working out on
the helipad, with the beautiful backdrop of the entire city of Los Angeles,
and leverage them in strategic Facebook and Instagram lead-generation
advertising campaigns. We think that this Hook Point will drive awareness
about Park’s new gym because we live in a selfie/social media world. We
believe that people will get excited about the opportunity to film them-
selves working out on a helipad overlooking the city of Los Angeles—the
ability to take these pictures is the hook. Then, once people are there, Peter

and his trainers will show them the real magic behind why they are some
of the best trainers in the world. This will then lead to some people con-
verting into private clients. Additionally, people attending the class will use
the content they capture on the helipad as Hook Points for their own per-
sonal social channels (showing off the experience to social followers), which
will then also serve as the most valuable form of advertising for Peter’s
gym—word-of-mouth endorsements.
Wrapping Up (the Box)
In the Lady Gaga and Platinum Fitness examples, both of these brands
figured out how to combine original Hook Points with something that
provides specific value to their target audiences. See how you can do the
same by pushing yourself to think outside the box. Do you have something
truly unique and original that helps you stand out and tell an interesting
story to your customers? (If you’re having difficulty coming up with out-
of-the-box ideas, I offer private strategy sessions to achieve this goal. If
you’re interested, email me at bkane@brendanjkane.com.)
WHY WE SHOULD KILL THE ELEVATOR PITCH
To capture people’s attention quickly, you can’t go into content creation or
meetings with your focus on the sale. People love to buy but hate to be sold
to—which is why you need to remain focused on providing value. If you
fail to do so and stay focused on the sale, the people you’re commu-
nicating with will feel it, get on edge, and want to shift their attention
elsewhere.

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 185
This is why I’m not a fan of elevator pitches. The definition of a pitch is:
“To present or advertise, especially in a high-pressure way.”
65 
Essentially,
you’re almost trying to force someone to buy something. Instead, use the
tools I’ve given you throughout this book to articulate your value proposi-
tion. Replace pitching with the use of Hook Points and storytelling.
I want to be clear, however, that of course I understand that your end
goal is to sell a product or service—we’re all in business to generate reve-
nue. But instead of focusing on selling your product or service, focus on
leveraging the value of your product or service and determining how it
solves a specific pain point or problem. There’s a huge difference between
language that’s designed to sell and language that expresses value.
LEVERAGING VALUE TO CONNECT WITH THE A-LIST
While speaking at Web Summit, the world’s largest tech event, I secured
the opportunity to interview Jon Seifert, worldwide CEO of the market-
ing, advertising, and public relations firm Ogilvy. When I met him, I asked
how many views his best-performing interview of all time received, to
which he replied, “Two million views on a CNBC interview.” I guaranteed
that the interview he did with me would have a larger reach because I
would apply my methodologies for the content distribution and testing
process that I built while working with Katie Couric. Instead of doing just
another press interview, which he probably did dozens of times that day, I
added extra value and stood out to him (and Ogilvy’s CMO) because I
made a bold claim and told a specific story about how I would make it

happen. Also, because I kept my promise (the interview generated 2.1 mil-
lion views), it led to my being connected with another high-profile CEO
at a major company.
By providing value, you create win-win situations, which helps you help
other people. And usually when you truly help people, they want to repay
you, which is why providing value is a great tool for acquiring and keeping
new business.
HELP WANTED—NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED!
You don’t necessarily need to have a ton of experience to provide value to
others—you can do it at all stages of your career. Back when I was starting
out as an assistant at the movie studio Lakeshore Entertainment, I was
helping with the social media campaign for the movie Crank. During this
time, I met actor Jason Statham, known for Snatch, Hobbs and Shaw, The
Transporter, and many other notable films. He saw the work I was doing
and asked if I would come to his house to do a social media strategy ses-
sion. This request came out of nowhere and felt like a very big deal at the
time—especially because I wasn’t trying to build a working relationship
with Statham. The opportunity simply arose from communicating with
him in an open and honest way, and by providing value.
Even as an entry-level assistant, I built trust and credibility with a
highly successful movie star. All I had to do was see how I could be of
value to him, be helpful, and do a good job. After the strategy session,
Statham realized he wanted to prioritize some other projects before com-
mitting to the work it takes to keep a social presence afloat. This was back
in 2008, so it was early in the social media game, and his focus was else-
where. Even though the meeting didn’t lead to more work, the value I

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 187
provided still got me in the door for an opportunity that most people only
dream about.
HOW TO APPEAR ON THE DR. OZ SHOW 35 TIMES
Michael Breus, The Sleep Doctor, shares that a key to securing media
opportunities is being a good date. His father used to tell him, “Always be
a good date. Be kind and polite whether or not you think there’s a romantic
connection, because they’ll always have a friend.” Breus took that advice to
heart for his career as well. He promised himself that he’d always do a good
job and be kind to everyone he meets because you never know where they’ll
end up. Applying this advice has worked in Breus’s favor. His first appear-
ance on The Dr. Oz Show stemmed from a connection with a producer he’d
met on another show called The Doctors. That producer eventually moved
over to Oz, and because he’d already seen Breus’s work, he trusted him and
brought him on the show.
In addition to being a good guest, Breus also provides the added value of
offering to consult with any member of the media who has a sleep prob-
lem. He believes that this added value also gets him asked back for media
appearances. When you help people personally, they’re more likely to trust
you. They’re grateful for your help and want to reciprocate by becoming
megaphones for your products or services.
It’s important to note that when Breus offers this kind of help, he doesn’t
expect anything in return. Let me repeat that: He doesn’t expect anything in
return. He simply offers advice because his work is important to him, and
he wants people to enjoy improved sleep and better lives. His authentic
desire to help is what gives him massive credibility and helps him secure
many media appearances.

188 HOOK POINT
THE SECRET TO GETTING HIRED FOR A TOP-TIER JOB
My father, Jim Kane, was one of the first lawyers to be hired (without a law
degree from an Ivy League or top-tier school) at one of the oldest firms in
Chicago. The firm dates back to the Civil War, and historically the major-
ity of attorneys working there had graduated from Ivy League law schools.
Clients went to the firm to find the best and brightest lawyers, which was
why the school a lawyer graduated from was extremely important. However,
in the 1990s, clients started looking not only for lawyers who’d graduated
from prestigious law schools, but also for those who could bring val-
ue-added representation—they sought out attorneys who could introduce
them to individuals and companies who could become potential business
partners.
My father had considerable experience before he went into private
law practice from working as the former director of real estate for the
city of Chicago. During this time, he made considerable contacts and
developed relationships with high-powered people in politics and the
real estate industry. When he applied to the prestigious firm, where he
eventually became partner, he marketed himself as someone who was not
only an accomplished attorney, but who also had contacts and working
relationships that could benefit the firm in its efforts to expand its cli-
ent base.
Eventually my dad went on to become involved in the hiring process for
new lawyers at the firm. Many applicants came from the top schools in the
nation, but he didn’t recommend hiring based solely on where someone
went to school. He was more interested in their interpersonal skills and
how they articulated their views about the legal profession. That gave him
the best insight as to how these individuals would communicate and inter-
act with both existing and potential clients. He looked for lawyers with

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 189
exceptional interpersonal skills and the potential to develop business down
the road. While interviewing, he asked questions that helped him under-
stand how candidates’ minds worked and whether or not they would be
nimble when dealing with existing and potential clients. Most import-
ant, my dad knew that candidates could have all the “book smarts” in the
world, but it meant nothing if they couldn’t communicate effectively and
develop relationships that produced new clients and additional revenue for
the firm.
Business is founded on relationships—and the ability to create and
maintain them is essential. Oftentimes you’re appealing to a potential boss
or client not only for the value you provide by doing your actual job, but
also for the additional value you bring through relationships or skills.
So, take some time to write down your background, additional skills,
and experience. I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how many added
benefits you bring to the table. Be sure to highlight these attributes in your
Hook Points and stories.
WHY 99 PERCENT OF PEOPLE FAIL
WHEN LOOKING FOR JOBS
When trying to secure new business or get hired at a company, 99 percent
of people fail because they approach potential employers thinking solely
about their own personal needs. They don’t think about the fact that man-
agers and decision makers often have several people approaching them
every day expecting to receive something from them. Less than 1 percent
of the people they talk to think about what the manager or decision maker
wants or needs; they forget that these people have their own problems
they’re attempting to solve.

190 HOOK POINT
When you look for a job or speak with potential new clients, go in with
the attitude, “How can I be of service to you?” rather than, “Please give me
a job.” You’ll elicit a much better response if you focus on what you can do
for them instead of what they can do for you.
HOW TO HACK YOUR WAY INTO ANY JOB
The truth about landing a great job or promotion is that it’s less about
proving your ability to do the job, and more about building trust and
a solid relationship. In fact, at Ernst & Young and Deloitte, employee
recommendations account for 45 to 50 percent of hires; and for those
who make it to the interview stage, the referred candidates have a 40
percent better chance of being hired than other applicants.
This is because employers hire people they could be friends with. A
lot of hiring is done because of someone’s attitude, not aptitude.
People often see their co-workers more than their wives, kids, and
friends. You can be smart, but you also need to be easy to work with
every day.
The secret to building trust with anyone is that it’s not about what
they can do for you, it’s about the needs you can fulfill for them, so
think about the needs of the people in the places where you’d like to
work. Some common needs include:
• A strong work ethic
• Trustworthiness
• Someone who’s fun to be around
• Creative thinking

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 191
• Persuasive speaking ability
• Being easy to talk to
• Care and concern for co-workers
• Specialized knowledge (e.g., technology, social net-
working, accounting, etc.)
Try to think about how you can meet the needs of those you’d like
to work with. If you think you have nothing to offer, you’re wrong—
everyone has something to offer. There are all kinds of talents, includ-
ing something as seemingly simple as the ability to listen and share a
passion for common interests. Figure out what you’re good at, and use
that as a starting point to form strong connections.
FULFILLING-NEEDS EXERCISE
Take ten minutes to write down a list of all the things you’re good at.
This should include both business and personal skills:
• Business examples: writing, public speaking, strategy,
content creation, analytics, math, accounting, etc.
• Personal examples: surfing, great with dogs, golfing,
making people laugh, etc.
Keep these skills in mind when talking with potential employers or
clients. Think strategically about how these skills can help you create
strong connections, and keep them in the back of your mind at inter-
views. Be mindful not to leverage irrelevant skill sets if they’re not of
value to those on the other side of the table (e.g., if an individual is

192 HOOK POINT
serious, don’t constantly try to crack jokes; or if you’re applying for a
writing position, don’t talk about the fact that you’re great at calcu-
lus—unless you’re working for a media company that has a math
focus. If you can provide true value to those around you, you’ll even-
tually secure your dream job.
THE SECRET TO HAPPINESS (WORK EDITION)
People lose the opportunity to work with great employees and service pro-
viders by not recognizing the value in those they want to hire. If you have
something of value, and a potential client or employer tries to negotiate
you down or doesn’t recognize what you’re worth, it’s probably not the
right fit. Yes, clients and employers pay you, but money isn’t everything. If
a company doesn’t make you feel appreciated, they’re not providing you
with enough value and you should walk away.
Personally, I don’t work simply for the paycheck. I work for clients who
appreciate the value I offer. If they don’t appreciate it, then although they
can meet my financial needs, they aren’t worth working with because they
can’t fulfill my psychological and emotional needs. This is important to
keep in mind when you’re the one hiring. If you appreciate the people you
hire, you’ll have a better chance of attracting A-list talent.
STOP KIDDING YOURSELF—EVERY INDUSTRY IS
THE SERVICE INDUSTRY
Erick Brownstein of Shareability was once told, “If you want to feel satis-
fied and happy in your life, be of service.” He’s taken this principle and

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 193
spread it across the various facets of his life. He believes that in business
meetings, you win the room by focusing on being of service. If you genu-
inely want to help others, you go further. In fact, he’s gone into meetings
with midlevel executives and told them that if they work with Shareability,
a primary goal of his will be to see them get promoted, which has actually
happened several times.
Brownstein also believes in giving away his best ideas and insights. He
recommends a book by Patrick Lencioni called Getting Naked, which is a
business fable about a consulting company that generates a lot of business.
The company doesn’t go into meetings with a big deck or presentation—
they informally talk with potential clients. They ask a lot of questions, give
away ideas, and approach the meeting with the mindset, “We’re already
working together.” Essentially, the fable shows how the consultants win
business through their genuine desire to be helpful.
DON’T PLAY THE VICTIM
You can deliver the same message in many different ways. When packaging
information in business, focus on sharing the benefits those you’re speaking
with will receive. That way you avoid coming across as self-serving. I once hired
a contractor who didn’t understand how to package information in terms of
providing value to his clients. This person would only present information
from his point of view, explaining how situations were beneficial to him. He
would go so far as to talk about what a rough time he was going through finan-
cially to try to make his clients feel sorry for him, in order to get more business.
This is not a good strategy—you don’t want anyone doing business with you
because they feel sorry for you. You want to make your intelligence, capability,
product, or service so good that others can’t stop working with you.

194 HOOK POINT
Eventually, I cut ties with this contractor, but at one point while he was
working for me, he told me that he wanted to raise his rates so he could
hire more people and sign up for platforms that would “make his job eas-
ier.” The language he used in his pitch was not effective. This proposal was
solely focused on what he needed and wanted. Had he been in the practice
of focusing on his clients’ needs, he could have proposed the same plan in
a way that made me feel that I was getting more out of his service by pay-
ing more. He could have said, “I’m upgrading my service to make it
more effective. You will benefit because of X, Y, and Z, but in order to
deliver at this higher level, I need to raise my rates to cover the necessary
expenses that allow me to offer this higher level of service.” If he’d pre-
sented the information in this way, I would have been far more receptive to
the idea.
So don’t play the victim, don’t try to get people to feel sorry for you, and
don’t be self-serving. Instead, play up your strengths, and always put your-
self in the other person’s shoes. We all want to work with individuals who
provide us with value.
I LOVE HOMEWORK! HOW TO PREPARE FOR
CRITICAL MEETINGS
John Kilcullen, creator of the For Dummies book series, recommends doing
your due diligence before you meet with people. If you do your homework,
you can provide potential clients with more value. Figure out if you have
any common connections, and do research on their markets. People pay
for timely solutions to unrecognized needs. If you can spot those needs,
you can paint a picture of what they’re missing and price your products
or services at a higher rate. Additionally, Kilcullen recommends having

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 195
conversations with the company’s customers and employees to find any
inside pearls of wisdom that may help you provide value.
HOW TO STAND OUT WITH BILLIONAIRES
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were approximately
338,000 personal trainers in the US in 2018, 
66 
so the fact that Peter Park,
the owner of Platinum Fitness, has differentiated himself and become such
a successful trainer at the highest levels is remarkable. He thinks that his
passion and love for training is a huge part of his value proposition. People
see that he lives for his job, and this passion helps him stand out. He won’t
stop until he sees a client improve, no matter if it’s a professional athlete, a
billionaire, or a person who’s just starting to train for the first time.
Focus on your areas of passion. People will pick up on your energy, and
it will provide them with value—we all want to feel ignited and enthusias-
tic! Clients and customers enjoy being around people who are happy and
positive.

co, has worked with the Black Eyed Peas since 2001. He explains that when
he first met these musicians, he was not only impressed by the positive mes-
sages in their songs but also by frontman will.i.am’s ability to connect with
all types of audiences. When he performed in Brazil, he wore the soccer
team’s jersey. When he performed in Mexico, he held up the country’s
national flag. It’s obvious that will.i.am is a genius when it comes to engag-
ing with people and discovering things that excite each individual culture.
Some people think that their products or brands are difficult to make
exciting—Jurkovac would argue that any brand has the capacity to create a
connection with consumers. He cites Morton Salt as an example of a brand
that has some incredibly engaging content even though salt wouldn’t nec-
essarily be considered a “sexy” subject.
One time Morton Salt created a video with a band called OK Go. The
hook is that the beginning of the video shows a complete moment that is
4.2 seconds long, and after it ends, it’s revealed that this 4.2-second part of
the video is actually a sped-up version of a longer piece of content that
was about four minutes long, which plays in its entirety right after the
4.2- second intro. The content worked in both the four-second format and
the four-minute-long version. (You can watch the OK Go—The One
Moment official video here: www.brendanjkane.com/okgo.) Because the
video was sponsored by Morton Salt, it connects the brand with a very hip
band and an interesting concept that got people excited—therefore, mak-
ing this brand of salt seem cool.
Another brand that has been able to make content engaging
against the odds is the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
They have an incredible Instagram account, which you can see here:
https://www.instagram.com/tsa/?hl=en. This account shares unique and

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 197
funny stories about all the crazy items that people try to bring through
airport security, including maple syrup, slingshots, and a ninja-throwing
star. TSA takes pictures of these items and accompanies them with funny
captions to warn people not to bring these things to the airport. The
account currently has more than a million followers. Jurkovac adds that no
one would think that TSA could make breakthrough content, but they do.
This is a testament to the fact that as long as you create unique content
that delivers relevant truths to viewers, you can be successful. If you make
people feel a connection with your brand, consumers will choose your
products and services over others.
DON’T TIE YOUR YOGURT BRAND TO A MAN’S
DECEASED WIFE: THE IMPORTANCE OF BRANDED UTILITY
Ernest Lupinacci, of Ernest Industries, explains that he really liked Google’s
Super Bowl commercial “Loretta,” which you can watch here: www
.brendanjkane.com/loretta. “Loretta” is about a man who has clearly lost
his wife but is able to reconnect with her through pictures that Google
Assistant finds for him. Lupinacci believes that the ad speaks to the fact
that “oftentimes our memories outlive the people, places, or things that we
remember.” Lupinacci loves that the ad is not using “borrowed interest,”
meaning it doesn’t attempt to merely entertain viewers with a reference to
popular culture. For example, this is not a commercial that strains to link
remembering a deceased love one with yogurt (which would not make
much sense to most people). Instead, Google’s ad has an authentic reason
to engage in a conversation about love, loss, memory, and nostalgia.
Focusing on branded utility, or how your products and services are use-
ful and meaningful to your customers, should be one of your main focuses

when coming up with Hook Points and telling stories. It helps you provide
more value and accelerates demand for your brand. As Lupinacci likes to
say, “Brand is the reward you get for keeping the promises you’ve made.”
So, use marketing to establish the promises you make, and demonstrate
how you’ve kept those promises.
HOW TO BUILD A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR T-SHIRT BRAND
My friend Zech Francis created a very successful T-shirt line called Society
that got into a huge retail chain called Buckle. I asked him how he made
his product line stand out. He explained that his office was located within
the largest T-shirt print factory in North America, which allowed him to
design, print, and ship new T-shirt designs to the Buckle executives over-
night. The speed at which he could address requests really impressed the
Buckle team. Executives could get on the phone, ask him to change any
aspect of his designs, and receive the shipment with new samples the very
next day—which is unheard of in the fashion world. This high level of
service made Francis more appealing to work with. In fact, after everything
he learned from Society, in 2018 he launched another brand with Buckle
called Dibs. Dibs experienced the fastest brand growth in Buckle’s 50-year
retail history—it went from zero dollars in revenue to seven figures in sales
in less than 45 days.

research on their prospects. They haven’t thought about the person or the
business they’re reaching out to. They’ve only thought about themselves
and how they can receive value. Please don’t do this. Rather, do your
research, and figure out how to offer value to whomever you’re reaching
out to.
To secure new business, it’s better to try and learn what others are up to
and offer ideas specifically tailored to their needs. It would be more bene-
ficial if these people approached me and said, “Hey, your company’s really
cool. I’d love to learn more about it and see if there’s a way I can generate
business for you. What are you guys up to?” If they showed interest in my
company and had a specific way to drive growth, it would help build a
relationship that could potentially lead to us working together.

Again, don’t use LinkedIn or email as a tool to harass your contacts—
you won’t get good results. Instead, be strategic—think about how you can
use these tools to connect, build relationships, and provide value.
An example of an effective cold outreach email that I received on
LinkedIn was:
This company gave me tangible evidence of the success they had with
other clients and appears to be focused on how they can help me achieve
similar results. This email got me to respond.
Through the use of cold outreach, I’ve personally closed deals with
Disney, Xbox, and Fox, which generated more than $15 million in busi-
ness. I simply used the tools I’ve shared with you throughout this book to
send effective messages to the right people.
The approach I take is to think about how I can provide the most value
to the contacts I’m reaching out to. I think about their pain points and how
I can help solve them. I don’t focus on selling my service, but instead on
how I can provide value with my service. It may seem like a small distinc-
tion, but it makes all the impact in the world.
When I sent a cold outreach message to an executive who worked at
Disney, which led to a sizable business partnership, I wrote about her value

204 HOOK POINT
and all the amazing work she was doing. I also added that I could save her
a bunch of money on YouTube advertising and significantly increase per-
formance on all the campaigns Disney was running. The email I sent was
completely positioned on helping Disney achieve more success.
Here’s an example of how it was structured:
Hi, [person’s name],
I first want to say congrats on all of your success at [company
name]. What you were able to achieve with [cite a specific proj-
ect, product, or campaign] is truly remarkable.
Because you’re an expert in the digital field, I wanted to let
you know about a new tech platform we’ve launched that pro-
vides exact data on what all of your competitors are spending on
social channels, along with insights on their past performance. It
also provides deep data on which videos visitors view before and
after watching a competitor’s video, as well as on which social
platforms they viewed the video.
The intriguing part of the platform is that all of this data can
then be mined and used to increase the quality score of your
own videos, which in return drops the cost per view of your own
campaigns and increases the organic virality of the video. The
best part of the platform is that it is 100 percent transparent and
can save you up to [insert impressive statistic] on your paid
media campaigns, while also increasing your performance by
[insert impressive statistic].
We’re currently using this new technology with [list client
names]. Because you’re always on the cutting edge of digital, I

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 205
wanted to forward this info along, as I thought it might be help-
ful. I would be happy to introduce you to my company’s CEO if
you’re interested in learning more.
Best,
Brendan Kane
Again, this email focuses on providing this executive with value. I highlight
her achievements and explain how my product can help her achieve more.
I offer to make her job easier and show her the value of using the service.
Also, I add further value by offering to introduce her directly to the CEO
(my role at the time was as an adviser to the company).
Now, variations of that email didn’t secure new business with everyone I
sent it to, which at the time was around 20 people. And prior to this batch,
I’d tested different variations of messages like this one to see which tweaks
could increase performance. If I’d received no responses from the message
above after sending it to 20 people, I would have modified it before send-
ing it to the next 20. But luckily, the one person from the one company
who did respond helped generate millions of dollars in business. Spending
the time to craft and send these cold outreach messages was obviously
worth my time—all I had to do was think about the pain points and needs
of the person on the other side of the table.
In-boxes are constantly filled with spam, which is why it’s critically
important to have a strong Hook Point and a strong value proposition. It’s
the only way to differentiate yourself so that the person you want to reach
actually opens the email in the first place.

ROCK CLIMBING, SNOWBOARDING,
AND ADVENTURES IN CONTENT MARKETING
Latham Arneson, former vice president of digital marketing at Paramount
Pictures, reminds us that information is by far one of the best and most
important pieces of content marketing. It’s human nature to want to learn
new things—if you provide people with the value of acquiring knowledge,
they may also want to buy the product you’re selling.
Arneson loves the “experience letters” that outdoor clothing brand
Patagonia publishes in their magazines. He gets to learn about new adven-
tures that motivate him to plan trips into the wilderness. He also learns
how people use Patagonia’s products during the adventures, which makes
him want to buy their clothing in preparation for his own.
You can provide knowledge around any product or service. A tax adviser
could educate potential clients with tips on the best ways to manage their
money throughout the year—the YouTube channel ClearValue Tax is a
great reference. A yoga teacher could send out a newsletter with the specific
benefits of various yoga poses or meditation practices. Ultimately, any type
of business can use content marketing to create a relationship with poten-
tial and current customers.
GIVE AWAY YOUR BEST STUFF
Too many businesses operate out of the scarcity mindset that if they put
out content for free, people won’t want to pay for their products and ser-
vices, when actually, the opposite is true—the more valuable the content
you put out there, the more people will want to hire you or buy your prod-
uct or service. You prove your value by letting people experience it.
Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, for example, provides a lot of valuable

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 207
information for free. In fact, he’s built his entire brand by doing so. And
the majority of free content he shares has substance—one time he gave
away an 88-page document outlining his content strategy, for which he
easily could have charged $1,500.
I’m not suggesting that you give everything away for free, but you do
need to understand the stage of communication you’re in with your audi-
ence. If it’s early on in the process, you need to focus on building trust. You
can’t ask for money right away; you need to provide value first.
In the retail environment, people give away free products all the time.
The whole purpose of giving out samples is to drive commerce by getting
people to try products and fall in love with them. It’s one of the reasons
why companies like makeup subscription service IPSY are so successful.
IPSY has a good Hook Point for both consumers and brands. The Hook
Point for customers is that they get to try the latest hair, makeup, skin-
care, and fragrance products that come in the mail each month, while
the Hook Point for brands is that they get their products into the hands
of a large array of potential consumers, many of whom will ultimately
turn into customers. This model provides a lot of value to all parties
involved.
Even when giving speeches, Michael Breus, The Sleep Doctor, gives
away valuable information that he hopes will be shared with others. At the
end of the presentations during his speeches, he always says, “Hey, every-
body, if you’d like a copy of my slides, text me your email address.” This
opens a door because people send him their email addresses, and then he
sends them a Dropbox folder with slides in a PDF format. The slides
include his bio, headshot, the different lectures he gives, the VIP services
he provides, and a handout with general sleep guidelines and recommen-
dations. This handout is valuable information that’s easy to remember and

208 HOOK POINT
share with others. By providing this value, Breus has received a number of
new clients and opportunities.
The smartest companies give away a lot of their best stuff. If you truly
help people, they’ll come back and figure out a way to spend money with
you. You gain their trust and open the door to a long-lasting relationship.
THE SECRET TO GENERATING FOUR BILLION VIEWS
Erick Brownstein of Shareability reminds us that in our new 3-second dig-
ital world, there’s an unbelievable amount of content being distributed at
all times. He thinks that now, more than ever, people need to realize that
engagement metrics are much more important than views. He emphasizes,
“Anybody can buy millions of views!” You have to create something that
people want to engage with, share, and discuss with others, and it’s essen-
tial that you think about what your viewers want.
Digital content strategist Naveen Gowda always tells his content pro-
ducers to imagine a person who’s just arrived to work and who’s scrolling
through their social feeds at 9:00 a.m. Then, he urges them to ask them-
selves, “What does that person need? What does my audience deem valu-
able, and what are their biggest pain points?” You can’t effectively articulate
value until you know your core audience and customers. Perhaps these
people need five-minute breaks or a pick-me-up during the day. At that
moment they’re not searching for your brand’s messaging; they’re looking
for something a little more creative (like the types of content ideas and
formats noted in chapter 3).
Entrepreneur Roland Frasier and Jay Shetty (a content creator who creates
viral wisdom videos that have garnered more than four billion views and who

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 209
has over 24-plus million followers globally
67
), had a conversation on Frasier’s
podcast, Business Lunch. Since Shetty is one of the most viewed people on the
internet internationally, Frasier asked him about shareability and the five
themes that help content go viral. Shetty shared that the five themes are:
adventure, comedy, emotion, inspiration, and surprise. He pointed out that
virality is in direct correlation to how often a video is shared, and that people
share a video not because it makes them think, but because it makes them
feel. If you provide people with value by making them feel surprised, happy,
amused, or inspired to do something new, they’re more likely to share your
video, and it will have a better chance of going viral.
Shetty believes that he has some of the most viewed videos on Facebook
for three reasons:
1. The concepts are developed from real-life experience. Shetty
comes up with video concepts from actual experiences or con-
versations he’s had with others. The idea for one of his most
shared videos came from a conversation with a 35-year-old who
felt that it was too late to take risks and try new things in his life.
Shetty recognized that this is a common feeling and decided to
make a video to debunk this myth.
2. Shetty uses scientific studies to back up his concepts. He wants
to present ideas that are credible and verifiable, so he always adds
in data to support his messages.
3. He uses poetic and simplistic language to explain his concepts.
Shetty points out that we remember lyrics more than prose.

You can gauge how well your content is performing by observing peo-
ple’s responses to it—look at the comments they’re making and how often
they’re sharing the content. This information is really great feedback about
how much value you’re providing. You can test different concepts, learn
what provides the most value, and allow this information to inform your
content strategy, both online and off.
LIONS, TIGERS, MANSIONS, AND LAMBORGHINIS—OH MY!
Expert copywriter Craig Clemens urges you to deliver value right away
when developing digital content. Make yourself a source for unique infor-
mation that people can’t get anywhere else and that helps them lead better
lives. It’s all about having a differentiator that draws people in, provides
them with value, and keeps them coming back for more.
It’s one thing to stop people from scrolling, but if you want them to keep
coming back to your page, you need to provide them with something valu-
able. Clemens cites Tai Lopez as an example of a creator who does this
successfully. Lopez holds a lot of capital in the social media advertising
space. He hooks people with pictures and videos of his Lamborghini and
mansion. That is his Hook Point, but the value he provides is what keeps
people around. He shares videos with the Hook Point, “You must read
these books!” Then he teaches lessons from the books that people can use
right away to grow their businesses or income. One of Lopez’s catch phrases

Take Everything I Have—It’s Yours for Free 211
is: “Knowledge is better than college.” It’s super easy to remember and leads
people to actions they can start implementing right away.
Give your audience actionable bites of information that can quickly
improve their lives, and they’ll keep coming back to receive them. Also, try
to make them feel like a part of your brand family or your own per-
sonal following. That way they’ll keep consuming your content and tell
their friends about it. Remember, the more value you give, the more value
you get.
Quick Tips and Recap
1. If a product or service doesn’t provide value, it shouldn’t exist.
2. If you focus on providing unique value to others, you will stand
out and capture attention.
3. You can win new business through your genuine desire and abil-
ity to be helpful.
4. People pay for timely solutions to unrecognized needs. If you
can spot those needs, you can paint a picture of what they’re
missing and price your products or services at a higher rate.
5. Business is founded upon relationships, so the ability to create
and maintain them is important.
6. Connect with your audiences through emotion, humor, sur-
prise, excitement, or education, and they’ll be more likely to
share your content at a higher rate.
7. Focusing on branded utility, or how your products and services
are useful and meaningful to your customers, should be one of
your main goals when coming up with Hook Points and telling
stories.

CHAPTER 8
FROM HOOK TO SCALE:
THE SECRET TO $1.6 BILLION
IN 48 MONTHS
Once you’ve built an effective business and marketing strategy that uses
clear Hook Points and stories, you’ll most likely reach a point where you
want to scale. Providing your customers with value will inevitably help you
grow, but oftentimes the hardest part is getting in front of the right audi-
ences with potential customers. Going to where traffic already exists, find-
ing Super Connectors (which I’ll explain later on in this chapter), leveraging
referrals, and combining online and offline marketing efforts are surefire
ways to help you scale, and this is exactly what we’ll cover in this chapter.
DON’T START FROM SCRATCH! GO WHERE
THE TRAFFIC ALREADY EXISTS
Many of the smartest and most successful companies have grown at a rapid
rate because they knew how to capitalize on audiences that were already
built. For example, YouTube sold their company to Google for $1.65

billion in less than two years by harnessing Myspace’s traffic.
68 
At the time,
Myspace didn’t have a video player built in to their platform. YouTube
recognized this fact and was one of the first companies to create a video
embed code that was compatible with Myspace. Myspace users took
YouTube’s embed codes and put them on their profiles. Whether it was a
music video, a movie trailer, or their own user-generated content, when
their social connections saw the videos on their friends’ profiles, they
wanted to follow suit. When users clicked on a video, they were sent to
YouTube’s website, where they could upload their own videos or grab an
embed code to put on their Myspace profile. The fact that YouTube har-
nessed Myspace’s built-in audience and traffic helped the business scale
rapidly, and the growth made them attractive to Google. Instagram lever-
aged a similar model, building a user base quickly off of Facebook’s
traffic.
Another good example is the existing traffic I harnessed by building rela-
tionships with bloggers. Back when I worked at the movie studio Lakeshore
Entertainment, I observed that film bloggers had a lot of power (and traf-
fic) that we could harness for our marketing campaigns. At the time, many
of the studios weren’t treating bloggers with the same respect as other media
outlets, such as Entertainment Tonight or traditional newspapers. However,
I saw the untapped opportunity in working with bloggers—their websites
were receiving a lot of traffic, and they had the ability to market Lakeshore’s
movies to thousands of film buffs. With this in mind, I reached out to
foster relationships with them.

-youtube-gets-bought-by-gooogle-for-165b-in-less-than-two-years/.

From Hook to Scale 215
To provide value to these bloggers, Lakeshore hosted parties where blog-
gers could interact with movie stars and industry people. One of the most
successful parties was sponsored by Lakeshore at Comic-Con and was
called “The Wrath of Con.” Movie bloggers had been hosting the party for
a couple years, but it was still small, with only around 50 attendees. At the
time, Lakeshore had a small independent movie called Pathology that we
didn’t have a big budget to promote. To get the bloggers to help us pro-
mote the film, we gave them money to throw a bigger party and invited the
stars of the film: Milo Ventimiglia (currently on the TV series This Is Us)
and Alyssa Milano. That year the party grew a ton, and with larger spon-
sors every year, it eventually turned into one of the biggest parties at
Comic-Con.
Investing in the party helped build relationships with the bloggers
because they were given access to stars and people they wanted to write
exclusive content about (which has now become a common practice in the
film industry). From then on, they were more inclined to market Lakeshore’s
films on their blogs, which put them in front of the eyeballs of many
potential moviegoers, quickly and cheaply. It was a win-win situation for
both sides.
You can do something similar in your industry. Think about where via-
ble traffic exists to promote your products and services. Once you uncover
a few places, if appropriate, think about how you can provide value to these
traffic drivers.
You can also harness traffic from the more general places where everyone
is going. Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk says, “The new NBC, ABC, and
Fox are Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.” People’s eyeballs are there, so
those are the best places to buy media and to get in front of potential
customers.

216 HOOK POINT
Expert copywriter Craig Clemens also recommends diversifying and
testing various traffic sources. In addition to social media sites, his com-
pany often tests traffic from HuffPost, TMZ, and other news sites. However,
Clemens cautions that because everyone’s eyeballs are generally in the same
place, it’s easier to find people than it is to grab their attention, which is
why the use of a really strong Hook Point is so important.
A SCALABLE TRAFFIC SOURCE TO
TEST YOUR HOOK POINTS
Social media advertising platforms provide traffic at scale that allows
you to test and learn quickly. You can test to find which Hook Points
provide success for awareness, lead generation, email list building,
e-commerce conversions, and follower growth. You will quickly know
the quality of your message by how effective it is at drawing people in
and getting them to click on your content.
HOW I LEVERAGED EXISTING TRAFFIC TO GENERATE
UPWARD OF 200,000-PLUS NEW INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS
IN A MONTH
I used existing traffic sources to grow my Instagram page to one million
followers at a very rapid pace. I generated upward of 200,000-plus follow-
ers in a single month and sometimes upward of 75,000-plus followers in a
single day. My Instagram growth strategy was to distribute content out
onto other Instagram accounts that had significant follower bases to get in

From Hook to Scale 217
front of their audiences and drive traffic back to my page. I tested content
extensively to see which Hook Points were strong enough to drive viewers
back to my channel so I could get them to opt in and follow the account.
To ensure the content was strong enough—prior to promoting it at scale
on various pages—I used one of my partner’s accounts, which has more
than four million followers. I would test various Hook Points and content
formats to see which ones most effectively grabbed people’s attention and
caused them to go to my account and click the “Follow” button. I would
measure the response to determine the effectiveness of each piece of con-
tent and test until I found the strongest variation. Then, once I was sure it
was working, I’d distribute the winning variation of content on between
seven and ten different partner accounts, each of whom had millions of
followers.

GET ONSTAGE! HOW SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS
DRIVE BUSINESS
The Sleep Doctor, Michael Breus, does a lot of speaking gigs. He does
them not only because they’re lucrative, but also because every time he
gives a lecture (in front of hundreds and in some cases thousands of peo-
ple), it’s an opportunity to garner new business that might come in the
form of an endorsement deal, a future speech, or a new patient. Breus
structures his lectures so that people in the audience identify with the ser-
vices he provides. In his lecture “The Exhausted Executive,” he gives tips,
hacks, and inside information all framed in two or three case studies that
allow the majority of audience members to feel represented.

218 HOOK POINT
For example, he may have a case study about John, who’s 45 years old
and reports feeling a high level of exhaustion every morning. He drinks a
little alcohol, has been gaining weight, and doesn’t exercise as much as he’d
like. Currently, he wakes up three to four times a night. Breus creates these
types of profiles or avatars through which he can display information. If
audience members identify with the case studies, they’re more likely to ask
questions during the Q&A sessions he does at the end of his talks, which
represent his true opportunity for sales.
During these Q&A sessions, audience members generally ask two types
of questions—personal questions or curiosity questions. When someone
asks him a personal question, Breus will generally respond, “Do me a favor
and meet with me afterward, because I’d like to talk with you about that
privately.” If he gets four or five of those types of questions, he has four or
five potential new clients.
MEET YOUR GATEKEEPERS
Breus was interviewed 241 times in 2018. Some months he was doing up
to 20 interviews. He secured the majority of these interviews by sending
out a journalists-only newsletter each month to all those in the media
who’d interviewed him in the past. In the newsletter he sends research
about sleep, and pitches Hook Points for their articles or TV shows. After
ten years of list building, he has access to more than 650 journalists in
every major media outlet in the world. He doesn’t need a publicist, because
he goes straight to the source. He’s built solid relationships with those who
can help him the most.

From Hook to Scale 219
SUPER CONNECTORS
To scale your business in the offline world, you need to look for what I call
Super Connectors—people who are well connected to those whom you
want to do business with. (Yes, I’m aware that there’s a book called
Superconnector, and my definition is a bit different, but this is the best term
for what I want to teach you.) You go to Super Connectors because they
have relationships with people who are typically hard to access.
You need to find the people in your industry who have the power to
connect you with potential partners, high-paying clients, traffic sources, or
customers. If you’re just starting out in your career, or are simply not a
skilled networker, Super Connectors are amazing assets. One well-respected
person can make dozens of introductions. I personally use this strategy
because I am naturally an introvert—it’s great for anyone who dreads the
idea of having to constantly go out and meet new people. One really
important Super Connector for me was the MTV executive I did licensing
deals with for my technology platforms. He opened the door to opportu-
nities with Taylor Swift, Vice magazine, Snoop Dogg, Michael Strahan, and
more (discussed in detail in chapter 1).
SUPER CONNECTORS CAN IMPROVE YOUR PRODUCTS
John Kilcullen, the creator of the For Dummies book series, thinks that a
major part of the success of this series can be attributed to the talented
writers who were brought on by Waterside Productions literary agent Bill
Gladstone (who also happens to be my agent). Kilcullen said that finding
great writers was essential, and Gladstone had access to a lot of them. He
became the gatekeeper and broker for finding writers who were not only
excellent explainers but who also had a comedic sensibility.

220 HOOK POINT
Gladstone, however, was not the only Super Connector who helped the
series thrive. Kilcullen had met Eric Tyson playing basketball on a street in
San Francisco, and he would eventually become the author of Personal
Finance for Dummies. They got to know each other through casual con-
versation, and then Kilcullen brought him in to talk to his colleagues
and employees. Tyson happened to be teaching a class for UC Berkeley’s
Extension program about personal finance, so they asked him to write the
book. Later on, they discovered that Tyson had a relationship with investor
Charles Schwab, who ended up writing the foreword.
Kilcullen feels that the series grew through the presence of great collab-
orators. It wasn’t built by just one person—they had a great team. You
never know who may end up becoming instrumental to your business’s
development, so be open, kind, and take the time to listen to everyone you
meet. They may open doors for referrals or for new ways to build traffic.
THE TRUE VALUE OF A CELEBRITY FOR YOUR BRAND
Alex Livian is the cofounder of LMS Inc., a modern-day distribution com-
pany that builds brands online. LMS uses the most advanced paid-media
growth strategies, with a heavy focus on building brands with high-profile
influencers. One of LMS’s most impressive clients is soccer player Cristiano
Ronaldo, and his underwear brand, CR7, for whom they’re the exclusive
distributors in North America. Ronaldo currently has the largest Instagram
following on the platform, with more than 205 million followers. This is
more than Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift, The Rock, and Ariana Grande
have! Due to his mass-market appeal, Livian has leveraged Ronaldo’s exist-
ing brand instead of creating one from scratch, which has helped him scale
rapidly.

From Hook to Scale 221
Livian chose to distribute Ronaldo’s CR7 brand because of the preestab-
lished trust the soccer player has built with his fans. If, instead, Livian had
started a line from scratch, he would have had to push harder to make the
brand known in the public eye. When you work with an existing brand,
you fast-track the marketing process because of the relationships the influ-
encer has already built.
Although the pros outweigh the cons, Livian says there are some
potential disadvantages to working with celebrities. You need to choose
those whom you trust because there’s always the risk that they can form a
negative image in the public eye, which can in turn hurt your brand and
sales. Livian cites how when celebrities are involved in a scandal or are
looked down upon in the public eye, brands that are associated with them
often have to back away to avoid putting the brand’s reputation in jeopardy
as well.
Also, when you attach your brand to one person, you increase the risk of
having your image spoiled by that person’s actions, so choose wisely.
Luckily, Ronaldo has been a safe choice for Livian. In addition to being
considered a god in the soccer community, Ronaldo has proven his
mass-market appeal through his massive social following. Tapping into this
loyal following has significantly lowered Livian’s cost per acquisition of
new customers.
When you partner with big influencers or celebrities, you also need to
make sure they have an authentic connection with your product. If they
don’t, it won’t help your marketing tactics. For example, Livian says that
when he sees Shaq in a Buick commercial, he thinks, The guy can’t even fit
in the car, and yet he’s the spokesman for the car . . . it doesn’t make sense.
Whereas when he sees George Clooney in a Casamigos tequila commer-
cial, he feels that it works because Clooney has a suave personality that

222 HOOK POINT
resonates with viewers, so the Casamigos brand matches his persona. The
pairing makes sense. If you can pair with the right people, whom people
trust, they will likely have faith in your product immediately.
If done right, working with celebrities can be a great way to scale your
business quickly. It lowers your cost per acquisition and can fast-track the
marketing process. You just have to make sure you choose wisely when
attaching your company and product to someone else’s name.
THE POWER OF REFERRALS AND HOW TO LEVERAGE
THEM TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS
Peter Park, the owner of Platinum Fitness, hardly does any traditional mar-
keting for his business. To date, all his clients, including his celebrity and
billionaire clients, have come via word-of-mouth advertising. Park explains
that many of his clients (especially those that are all-star athletes or CEOs)
value their privacy and don’t want the general public to know what they’re
up to. To protect and maintain trust with his clients, Park is cautious about
how he uses social media and other newer forms of advertising. Park and I
have become friends, and now, every time we talk, I learn about a new
celebrity client I had no idea he trained. It organically comes up in casual
conversation, and he never boasts or brags, which is another reason why
top A-listers love him.
Park has some big referral sources for his business, including Dr. Chris
Renna (another Super Connector), who is one of the top doctors in the
world. Dr. Renna, along with three or four other physicians, send Park a lot
of clients. To the people these doctors refer, they usually say, “If you want
to get in shape, Peter’s the best. He’s really professional. You can learn more
about his philosophy in his book.” And because these doctors are some of

the world’s top medical professionals, their patients trust them and there-
fore inherently trust Park.
Park’s referrals also come from the results he obtains for his clients. You
gain new clients by living up to your word and delivering on your promises
to your current clients. When Park helps people lose 30 pounds or strength-
ens their backs so they can pick up their kids for the first time in years, he’s
changed their lives. That joy and gratitude turns into testimonials, and
those testimonials turn into referrals.
My father, Jim Kane, explains that the majority of new business at his
former law firm (one of the oldest and most respected in Chicago) also
came from referrals. Attorneys had to go out and find new clients, and
many of them would join organizations related to their field of expertise so
they could network. Connections were key.
My dad had an advantage because he’d worked for a former mayor of
Chicago and a former governor of Illinois. Mayors and governors are always
involved in major transactions within their municipalities or states, so
gaining their confidence in his ability gave my father leads on potential
clients. You can never underestimate the importance of relationships in
developing new business.
Having relationships with important people related to your industry can
help you scale, so try to gain the trust of one or two Super Connectors so
they can refer business to you. If you focus your effort and energy on the
right people, you’ll scale faster.
CAUTION: STEADY SCALE AHEAD
When doctors refer people to Peter Park, they cite him as the expert and
not his business, Platinum Fitness. But this has created a problem for Park.

224 HOOK POINT
He has too many clients and can’t take on all of them himself, which is why
he has built a world-class team to help him. Unfortunately, though, when
referrals hear Park’s name, they don’t necessarily want to work with a mem-
ber of his team—they want to work with him personally—limiting the
success and scalability of his company.
I’ve been working with Park to reposition his message. Now, when some-
one gives him a referral, he expresses the value of his entire team. I’ve
coached him to change his story to emphasize the fact that he works with
a team of specialists, all of whom focus on a specific area. If someone is
struggling with back issues, there’s an expert on his team for that; if it’s a
knee issue, another person handles that area of expertise. Organizing his
team in this way helps shift the Hook Point from “Park is the best in the
world” to “Park’s team is the best in the world,” which will help his business
scale more efficiently.
Think about how you are positioning yourself when you create your
Hook Points and stories. Make sure they’re scalable for the long-term future
of your business. Thinking ahead will help you grow more efficiently.
TARGET BEYOND YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC
When leveraging paid advertising, the most common strategy is to hyper-
target your advertising content to the specific niche audience that is most
likely to purchase your products or services. When it comes to organic
social media, however, many times it’s smart to focus on a content strategy
that goes extremely broad, which will eventually connect you to your niche
audience.
When digital content strategist Naveen Gowda was designing social
content at First Media, his team was going after huge wins. So instead of

From Hook to Scale 225
simply targeting fans of DIY craft projects, for example, they worked on
designing their content for a much broader audience. They did so because
of how the algorithms work (as explained in detail in chapter 3). Reaching
a broader audience allowed their videos to generally gain between 30 mil-
lion and 100 million views. In that way, they didn’t only hit their core
audience, but they also captured new audience members who wouldn’t
have seen their content otherwise.
The high level of interest in these videos allowed First Media to evolve
the structure of the brand, expanding their audience beyond babies and
millennial moms to millennial women and other verticals. Reaching a
wider audience gave the business new possibilities. In two and a half years,
they went from being a digital team of only three people to one of more
than 55 people who were generating approximately three billion views a
month.
When first launching social paid advertising campaigns, I generally rec-
ommend targeting a wide audience and letting the data reveal your true
audience. I discuss the social media-targeting process in detail in my first
book, One Million Followers (www.onemillionfollowers.com), which you
can read more about; but for now, just know that there may be audiences
you never dreamed would be interested in your product, and you can use
social platforms to test and discover your ideal customers.
THE REVERSE OF 1,000 TRUE FANS
In Kevin Kelly’s book, 1000 True Fans, he outlines the idea that you only
need 1,000 true fans who will pay you $100 each to gain $100,000 a year.
He recommends building this audience slowly over time so that you’re
certain these people will buy your products or services. Although I respect

226 HOOK POINT
the concept and think there’s value in it, I want to explain why I take a
different approach.
I started out in the entertainment industry, where reaching an audience
of 1,000 people is way too small to provide a return on investment. If I
walked into a meeting with a concept that would only reach 1,000, or even
10,000, people, I’d be fired. I had to show up with ideas for reaching mil-
lions of people in the shortest possible amount of time.
As a result, my mind has been trained to think big when it comes to
potential audience size. When promoting a movie (other than a sequel),
you have to build a brand in less than a few months. Those brands cannot
survive on a mere 5,000 or even 10,000 people. You have to reach 20, 30,
50, or 100 million people in a very short period of time.
My background in the entertainment industry trained me to quickly
reach huge amounts of potential consumers in very short time frames. I
think that knowing how to do so provides people from any industry with
a unique opportunity. Whether you’re an author, a writer, a chef, or an
athlete, knowing how to reach the masses helps.
Recently, I looked at the social media accounts of the world’s top chefs.
Many of the really big ones, even Wolfgang Puck, have fewer than 215,000
Instagram followers (at the time of writing this chapter). For Instagram,
this is not a huge number, but it’s a large number for the culinary world.
Imagine a chef with 300,000 to 350,000 followers—this person would
stand out in that niche industry. People who are outliers because of their
large audience sizes attract attention. They can leverage a larger-than-
average audience size to gain new opportunities, brand deals, appearances
on podcasts, and spots on television shows.
Again, there’s tremendous value in having 1,000 true fans; it’s a great
accomplishment that can help your business. But by having the largest

From Hook to Scale 227
possible exposure, you’re more likely to find your 1,000 true fans quicker
in addition to larger offline opportunities. I grew one million followers
in 30 days so I could go as wide and as loud as possible. I knew that not
all one million would be true, dedicated fans who would buy something
from me; that wasn’t the point. The point was leveraging the hook (zero
to one million followers in 30 days) to get onto podcasts, speaking stages,
and television shows; and to build strategic partnerships that would give
me even more exposure, accelerating my path to 1,000 true fans—and
even more.
I urge you, too, to think as big as possible. What kind of opportunities
would be life changing for your career? How can you use your audience size
to expose yourself to potential change makers? In other words, go as big
and loud as possible so you can grab the attention of more of the right
people who can make impactful changes in your career trajectory.
SCALE BY COMBINING ONLINE AND OFFLINE EFFORTS
There are many ways to merge your online and offline presence to further
fuel brand awareness, drive massive growth, and create meaningful oppor-
tunities. If you effectively combine your offline and online presences,
which I explain below, you can truly scale and create a long-lasting brand:
Social Numbers for Offline Validation
Anyone trying to release content recognizes that a large social following, if
authentic, is a validation metric. It causes people to pay attention to you.
People will more likely want to look at your content if masses of others are
already doing so. It’s human nature.

228 HOOK POINT
Build your audience as widely and quickly as possible so you can use it
as a validation and credibility metric. This will help you stand out, because
only a small percentage of people can achieve it. That in itself will become
a Hook Point for you. It might not be the hook you lead with—that hook
is likely related to what you actually do in your business. But whether
you’re a doctor, an author, an actor, or a writer, a large social following will
cause people to pay attention to you and absorb your core messages.
How I Turned My Social Audience into Offline Opportunities
As you know, I generated one million Facebook followers in 30 days and
then figured out how to reach one million Instagram followers in a very
short period of time. A lot of people find that fascinating, and it helps me
stand out. I’ve used the hook of that achievement, which took place online
as a story I’ve told offline. It has helped me fuel attention, awareness, edu-
cation, and inspiration.
As you’re probably aware, building a large following presents revenue-
generating opportunities through brand partnerships and influencer deals,
and also builds business relationships with your brand. Social platforms’
advertising capabilities can also be leveraged to generate leads for potential
clients and to directly sell your products and services online at scale. But
what I find even more interesting than the online opportunities these
platforms provide is the fact that once people begin engaging with your
content, or buying your products and services online, you can take that
momentum and transfer it to significant opportunities offline.
You can take your online following and use it as a leverage point to get
strategic partnerships, deals, and to get people to take you more seriously.
One clear example is actress Sophie Turner (best known for her role as

From Hook to Scale 229
Sansa Stark on the HBO series Game of Thrones), who admits that she was
once chosen for a role over another actress she considers “far better” because
Turner has a larger social following.
69
Personally, I leveraged the story about my accomplishments online to
secure a literary agent, which allowed me to acquire a publishing deal.
Suddenly, I had a physical product in the offline world that was created
because of what I did in the online world. Then I went back to the online
world and used my social platforms to sell my book. From there, I lever-
aged the Hook Point of my large social following—and the fact that I
wrote a book about it—to secure speaking engagements on stages around
the world. I spoke at prestigious events hosted by IKEA, Mindvalley, and
Web Summit (which has an audience of more than 70,000 people).
The fact that I had a good Hook Point, a published book, and several
speaking engagements under my belt gave me the opportunity to appear
on well-known podcasts with large followings around the world. This
exposed me to even more audiences, and I reached still more people with
my message. Then, this led to opportunities to appear in media outlets
such as Fox Business, SiriusXM, KTLA, Yahoo! Finance, and more, which
gave me even more clout and exposed my brand to still more people.
Do you see how each step both online and offline created a snowball
effect to continue the growth of my brand? I took the story of my large
social audience and established myself in other offline mediums, which
you can also do. Whether you have 1,000,000 or 10,000 followers, don’t
limit yourself to thinking about that following in terms of direct revenue

230 HOOK POINT
or brand deals. People will take you more seriously because of your social
credibility, so leverage it. You can widen your opportunities to obtain stra-
tegic partnerships and deals offline, which will likely lead to larger deals
and revenue potential than if you were to solely focus online.
Take an Offline Brand and Grow It Online
This process can also work in reverse. One recent example is the work I’m
doing with Michael Breus, The Sleep Doctor. As mentioned previously,
Breus has built a tremendous offline brand. He’s spoken at many events
and has appeared on many television shows, including The Oprah Winfrey
Show, the Today show, and The Dr. Oz Show. However, despite this tremen-
dous exposure and success, he hasn’t had a similar level of growth online.
As noted earlier, at speaking events, Breus collects email addresses to
find potential clients at the end of each talk. However, after years on the
speaking circuit, he’s only acquired a few thousand emails. When we met,
I shared that in the online space, that number of email addresses can be
acquired in just one or two days. We’re currently working to take his Hook
Points and all the data he’s collected offline to fuel his growth online. This
will allow his online and offline exposure to work together to grow his
brand and business.
You can also take your best-performing offline Hook Points and push
them to people online. You can reach hundreds of thousands of potential
customers online within days, and if they resonate with your content,
they’ll provide you with their names and email addresses. For example, one
of The Sleep Doctor’s Hook Points that we discussed earlier is, “What is
the perfect time to have sex before going to bed?” Breus can make a video
that answers this question and push it to more than a million people

From Hook to Scale 231
through the social-testing strategies I outlined in my first book, One Million
Followers. By offering this engaging content for free, he will acquire thou-
sands of names and email addresses. From there, he can leverage this new
email distribution list amassed online for further revenue opportunities
(e.g., online courses, sponsorships, book promotions, and workshops).
This is just one example of what can happen when you learn how to
make online and offline exposure work together. Instead of solely focusing
on building your business offline or growing online, look at how these two
engines can fuel each other. Leverage your growth in both spaces cohesively
to drive massive growth.
Test Your Stories Offline
My goal in achieving one million followers was to allow me to have offline
conversations. Although I could have immediately leveraged the following
for brand deals and other revenue opportunities, I felt that the digital space
was already very crowded, with lots of influencers. I wanted to have a
stronger hook. I wanted to differentiate myself and felt that leveraging the
following more strategically for offline opportunities would drive more
potential growth and scale for my brand.
With that said, recently I’ve looked into hiring someone to obtain brand
deals for me to see how I can specifically leverage them online. Again, you
can make money directly from your following, and some influencers make
millions of dollars through their online interactions. If that’s your goal, I
hope you do the same. However, I urge you to look at the broader picture.
It’s really exciting that you can take what you build online and amplify
your message, grow your brand, and create unique opportunities for scale,
both offline and online.

232 HOOK POINT
Mine Podcasts for Big Opportunities
My appearance on the podcast Finding Mastery: High Performance Psychology
with Michael Gervais presents another example of combining offline oppor-
tunities with online awareness. This highly successful podcast has a large
audience, so my appearance allowed me to close a significant amount of
revenue—executives at several large companies who listen to the podcast
reached out to hire me.
To acquire these new clients, I used the process of combining online and
offline efforts. I leveraged the book (an offline item) and the Hook Point
of gaining one million followers (an online strategy) during a meeting that
came through an introduction from a friend (an offline interaction) to get
on the podcast (online), which got me work (offline) through exposure to
a large audience (online)—some of whom reached out to work with me
(both online and offline). Okay, that’s a mouthful—I hope you’re not too
confused. But the point is that combining online and offline efforts works!
Can you start to see how the online and offline worlds meet, interact with,
and support each other? In this example, offline and online interactions are
constantly being leveraged back and forth to enhance one another and
create opportunities. It all starts with having an interesting Hook Point and
story that you can leverage across different mediums. That way you can
diversify your audience and grow your brand recognition.
HOW TO LAND YOUR FIRST PODCAST APPEARANCE
You can take several approaches to appear on your first podcast. One way
is to hire a publicist. Publicists generate and manage publicity, and in addi-
tion to finding podcasts, they can find radio, television, and print oppor-
tunities. But make sure to do your research. Choose someone who won’t

From Hook to Scale 233
lock you into a long-term contract (you want to test out this person to see
if he or she can actually deliver), whom you enjoy working with, and who
understands your brand.
Another way to get on a podcast is to hire a company that specializes in
finding podcast opportunities for potential interviewees. A company called
Interview Valet focuses on podcast interview marketing. They can help
place you on podcasts that are a good match. They’ll also help you prepare
for the interview and promote it on social media.
70 
In my experience, how-
ever, companies such as these usually only place you on podcasts with audi-
ences ranging from 1,000 to 40,000 downloads per episode rather than the
top shows generating 100,000-plus downloads per episode. However, it’s a
great place to start.
(If you’re looking for an introduction to Interview Valet, please email me
at bkane@brendanjkane.com.)
Referrals from colleagues and friends have helped me land appearances
on top-rated podcasts. Strategic introductions are always the easiest and
best sources to leverage—not to mention, they’re usually free. But if you
don’t yet have those types of relationships, you can either focus on identi-
fying Super Connectors to help you, or on building a large audience to
leverage for new potential connections and partnerships.
This brings us to the next way to gain podcast appearances—you can
leverage a large social following to appear on podcasts or to build your own
podcast. Podcasts need audiences. If you have a large social following, peo-
ple will want to interview you to grow and expand their own networks.
Alternatively, you can create a podcast by attracting guests who want to
be exposed to your following. Jay Shetty started out as a viral content

creator and leveraged his success to build a very successful podcast called
On Purpose with Jay Shetty. He’s had guests such as entrepreneur Gary
Vaynerchuk; personal-transformation pioneer and integrative-medicine
doctor Deepak Chopra; Grammy Award–winning singer Alicia Keys;
Jordan Belfort, the author of The Wolf of Wall Street; reality TV star Khloe
Kardashian; award-winning actresses Kate Bosworth (best known for
Superman Returns and Blue Crush) and Eva Longoria (best known for her
work on the TV series Desperate Housewives); and clothing designer
Kenneth Cole. Inviting these people on his podcast has given Shetty clout
and increases his ability to reach new audiences. He also makes strategic
connections with the guests who may benefit him in the future. In turn,
the guests, regardless of how large an audience they may already have, can
pick up new fans as well.
The combination of having one million followers and the hook that I
built it in, in less than 30 days, has landed me on a plethora of podcasts.
When hosts see that I have one million followers, they realize that my
social credibility warrants asking me to speak on their shows. They view it
as beneficial for their growth on top of it being a great story that their audi-
ences can engage with.
Once you’ve been on a few podcasts, other podcast hosts will start seek-
ing you out. People who’ve heard me on podcasts reach out via LinkedIn
with other podcast- appearance opportunities two or three times a week.
Being on a few podcasts can lead to a snowball effect if you maximize every
appearance and do a great job. When people hear how amazing you are,
they’ll begin to contact you.
When starting out, I recommend taking every podcast opportunity you
can get. Regardless of the size of the podcast, I usually say yes to any appear-
ance opportunity that comes my way—I’m open to the exposure each one

From Hook to Scale 235
provides. Even if I’m only talking to a hundred people, I think it’s worth it.
These appearances usually take only 20 or 30 minutes of my time and give
me the chance to practice for bigger opportunities.
LANDING YOUR FIRST SPEAKING GIG
Before I tried to obtain a speaking gig, I hired a speaking coach. I take
speaking very seriously and didn’t want to go into it lightly. I’d seen the
difference between trained and untrained speakers. Some think that cha-
risma is enough, but successful speakers structure their speeches. They
apply a methodology that makes them keynote worthy. Because I aspired
to speak at the highest levels, I wanted to become an expert.
(If you’d like an introduction to my speaking coach, email me at bkane@
brendanjkane.com.)
When I felt confident, I started telling all my friends and colleagues that
I was looking for speaking opportunities. A business partner introduced
me to a few people who work in event planning. From that meeting, I was
introduced to IKEA and had the opportunity to speak and run a workshop
with IKEA’s creative global team in Sweden.
As is the case with podcasts, a snowball effect comes into play. The more
speaking gigs you do—and perform well at—the more referrals you’ll
receive. If people see that you deliver a good speech, they’ll want to hire
you to speak at their events. In addition, many audience members may be
potential clients/customers.
At your first speaking gig, connect with the other speakers in the green
room. These people are always a great resource for referrals for other speak-
ing opportunities. For example, I met Michael Breus, The Sleep Doctor, at
a speaking event, and now he refers me to additional events.

236 HOOK POINT
Again, referrals are always the best and easiest way to find new opportu-
nities, but you can also hire a manager. I signed with a manager who rep-
resents me to scale the number of paid speaking gigs I do in a year. Not
everyone is in the position to secure a manager, but you can always do cold
outreach yourself. Make a list of the people in your field who are paid to
speak. Go to their websites and take a look at events where they’re speak-
ing, and the dates. Then pitch yourself to the events on that list.
You probably won’t get paid for your first speaking event—unless you’re
a big celebrity, already have a well-known brand, or are an expert in some-
thing very specific. Most likely you’ll start out speaking at events for free,
which will then eventually lead to paid opportunities. In my case, the gig
at IKEA was paid, but again, it came through a strategic introduction.
However, even after that, when I was just starting out, I spoke at many
unpaid events to build up my credibility and speaking reel.
To acquire more speaking opportunities, I also leverage the fact that I
stand out because of my large social audience. I let event planners know
that I can promote their events to my audience. Event planners always
want to hear this; it’s valuable to them.
At Web Summit, I took my digital advertising expertise a step further to
provide value. With more than 70,000 attendees, Web Summit is one of
the largest tech conferences in the world. When I met the event organizers,
I’d done some research to find out how many people had viewed their top
video, which had around one million views at the time. I told them I could
beat that amount of views and then leveraged my advertising strategies
outlined in One Million Followers to produce a video from the event that
generated more than 1.2 million views.
This campaign for Web Summit allowed me to stand out from a credi-
bility standpoint. The event organizers were extremely happy about the

From Hook to Scale 237
results because I provided value that no other speaker had previously cho-
sen to provide. Doing so helped me, as well. I have since leveraged the case
study about what I did for Web Summit to obtain other paid speaking
opportunities. This case study shows event organizers what I can bring to
the equation. Providing this value has given me the opportunity to speak
all over the world. Even as I write this, I’m speaking at an event in Portugal.
APPEARING ON YOUR FIRST TELEVISION SHOW
I ended up on my first TV show through a relationship I’d cultivated for
about ten years with a friend who has a show on Fox Business. I didn’t
foster that relationship because I wanted to get on this woman’s show, nor
did I ever think I would end up there, but that’s how it happened.
All my other TV appearances have come through a publicist. Television
has not been my main focus, but again, it’s a matter of looking at the con-
nections you already have, providing unique value, and leveraging your
social audience. TV producers want people who already have audiences
because they believe this will translate into more viewership. The amount
of people tuning in matters. Leveraging your social validation and credibil-
ity will help you stand out and will increase your chances of landing on TV,
which in turn will help your business scale.
Quick Tips and Recap
1. Don’t try to create traffic for your products, services, and con-
tent from scratch—go where the traffic already exists.
2. Social media advertising platforms are a great scalable traffic
source that allows you to test and learn at scale.

238 HOOK POINT
3. You can use existing traffic sources to grow your social following
at a very rapid pace. I generated upward of 200,000-plus follow-
ers in a single month, and sometimes upward of 75,000-plus
followers in a single day.
4. To scale your business in the offline world, you need to look for
Super Connectors—people who are well connected to those you
want to do business with.
5. Working with the right celebrities can fast-track your marketing
process.
6. You never know who may end up becoming instrumental to
your business’s development, so be kind, open, and take the time
to listen to everyone you meet.
7. Referrals and word-of-mouth advertising are some of the best
and most effective ways to market your business.
8. Make sure your Hook Points are scalable for the long-term
future of your business.
9. Go as big and as loud as possible so you can grab the attention
of the right people who can make impactful changes in your
career trajectory.
10. If you effectively combine your offline and online presences, you
can scale more quickly and create a long-lasting brand.

Now that you understand how to create Hook Points, tell compelling
stories, build trust and credibility, listen, provide value, and scale your busi-
ness, you’re ready to attract prominent clients, close bigger deals, and sur-
vive high-level situations. The key to building and maintaining an
impressive client roster is knowing how to make decisions that keep you
top of mind and that help you stand out as world class, in seconds.
SELENA GOMEZ AND JIMMY FALLON CRY
WHILE EATING SPICY WINGS (HOT ONES)
You don’t have to invent a new product or service to attract top-tier
clientele—you just need to find innovative ways to package your products
and/or services to make them more attractive. Hot Ones, created by

240 HOOK POINT
Christopher Schonberger, is a web series where celebrities are interviewed
by host Sean Evans while eating a platter of increasingly spicy chicken
wings. The Hook Point that draws people to this show is that the biggest
celebrities eat the hottest wings in the world and have insane reactions to
how hot they are during the interview. These wings are so hot that some
guests have cried, others have thrown up, and comedian Bobby Lee even
shat himself.
71 
The show’s tagline is: “The show with hot questions, and
even hotter wings.” Guests are asked a question after each chicken wing
they eat, and if they’re able to eat all ten of the wings, they get to promote
the project they’re working on at the time. Guests who fail to eat the wings
are also afforded the opportunity to promote their projects . . . but they’re
added to the show’s “Hall of Shame.”
Hot Ones has featured major celebrity guests such as Scarlett Johansson,
Shaq, Seth Meyers, John Mayer, Kevin Hart, and Natalie Portman; and
there was even a live version of the show with Selena Gomez on The Tonight
Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Schonberger attracted this clientele by coming
up with a novelty factor that made interviews more fun and unique. The
Hook Point allowed him to stand out and attract world-class guests in a
very crowded space.
Think about how you can take seemingly common products or services
and give them a spin that makes them stand out. If you find ways to be
innovative, it may help you more quickly attract the kinds of clients you’ve
been dreaming about.

Standing Out as World Class . . . 241
OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING WORLD-CLASS CLIENTS
Top-tier clients can be difficult to reach, but if you have something of value
to offer and you go about it in the correct way, they are obtainable. Many
people are often impressed that I’ve worked with Taylor Swift, but what
they don’t realize is that it’s not as difficult as often presumed to get a client
like her. To reach someone of that stature, you just need an efficient strat-
egy. I applied the strategy of reaching out to a Super Connector (outlined
in the last chapter). If you want access to someone like Swift, you don’t go
to her directly. You have to reach out through the trusted circle around her
and provide value to an individual within it. As I mentioned earlier, when
I met Swift’s manager, father, and mother, I provided them with value so I
could attain the ultimate goal of working with her. If I’d gone straight to
Swift, it wouldn’t have worked because most likely she wouldn’t have taken
a meeting with someone without a trusted referral.
HELLO, CELEBRITY, DO YOU TRUST ME?
Once you’re in the sphere of the high-profile people you want to work
with, you need to focus on developing trust. Celebrities, CEOs, and bil-
lionaires often put up their guards to protect themselves from the many
people who try to use them for their own personal gain. You’ll stand out if
you have a genuine conversation with them without trying to make a sale.
If you simply listen and offer solutions to their problems and growth obsta-
cles, they’ll be more likely to want to work with you. The choice to provide
valuable information and insights will put you light-years ahead of others
who approach high-profile people.
Michael Breus adds that a lot of billionaires, millionaires, and celebrities
work off of social credibility—not how many Facebook or Instagram

242 HOOK POINT
followers you have, but the level of prestige in the articles you’ve written
and your media appearances. He recommends that you maintain an up-to-
date bio of yourself with your media coverage included so you can prove
your social credibility quickly. Breus then leverages this credibility to per-
form cold outreach in order to connect with celebrities. For example, he’ll
look for news stories about celebrities who aren’t sleeping well and contact
them to offer assistance.
Breus usually writes something along the lines of, “Hey I’m a sleep spe-
cialist, and I’m not far away. I think I might know what’s going on with
you. I’d love to help you out at no charge.” Nine times out of ten, the per-
son will take the time to look him up and meet with him based on his
proven track record. The best part is that once Breus has helped the person
heal, he or she often talks about the great work Breus does, which generates
even more business.
With billionaires, however, he moves a bit more slowly (albeit steadily).
You never want to come across as though you’re after high-profile people’s
money, so if Breus sees that a billionaire has a sleep-related issue, he won’t
reach out, saying, “Hey, let me fix your problem.” Instead, to build rap-
port, he may send the person a couple of articles in which he’s been fea-
tured that address the individual’s specific problem. That’s why being
interviewed in newspapers, magazines, or journals that wealthy people
read, such as The Robb Report, Business Insider, or the Wall Street Journal, is
so helpful for lead generation—it helps establish credibility fast.
If people aren’t reporting on the types of issues that you cover with your
products or services, think about where celebrities and billionaires hang
out and how you can get in front of them. For example, Breus works with
the Young Presidents’ Organization. A business has to gross more than $10
million a year to be invited into this club. When Breus gives a speech to

these types of groups, he’s putting himself directly in front of the popula-
tion he wants to reach. Joining a country club or giving a lecture at an
exclusive club helps you network, build new relationships, and garner busi-
ness. These relationships also lead to referrals, which, in the long run, is the
best strategy for reaching high-profile individuals.
So, develop strategies for reaching out to prominent people. Build trust
with their inner circle, and put yourself in situations where you’ll be seen
by those you want to work with. If you’re good at what you do, and hon-
estly try to provide solutions with your products and services, you’ll go far.
WHAT KEEPS A CEO UP AT NIGHT?
To prepare for a meeting with clients at a high level, Erick Brownstein of
Shareability will ask himself, “What keeps the CEO up at night?” He’s
found that this is what successful consultants who work with huge compa-
nies think about—they try to discover the kinds of problems that CEOs
want to fix. When in rooms with leaders of organizations, Brownstein will
often ask, “As the leader of this company, what are your biggest priorities?”
as well as “What are your biggest concerns?”
After some experience engaging with people at this level, Brownstein real-
izes that his CEO clients are probably not thinking, How many views is our
next viral video going to get? but rather, The world has gone digital, and we hav-
en’t. How can we be a significant player in this new world? A CEO’s concerns are
extraordinarily different from those of directors of brand marketing who have
set budgets and metrics by which they’re measured. You need to take a very
different approach when pitching yourself to each of these parties.
Recently, Brownstein was on a call with the chairman of a massive global
conglomerate driving nearly $50 billion in revenue. To secure that
Standing Out as World Class . . . 243

244 HOOK POINT
meeting, Brownstein’s Hook Point was: “I understand that you’re focused
on your company’s involvement in raising awareness about climate change
and the role that corporations play. We’re working with the DiCaprio
Foundation and several other big players who are also focused on that issue.
I’d love to talk about how we could combine resources to have a bigger
impact.” The Hook Point above is very different from the one Brownstein
would have used with a manager of one of the nearly 100 brands that this
company owns. It’s also much longer of a Hook Point than he would have
used for promoting to the masses. (The Hook Point in this longer format
works because it’s targeted to one specific person and is being deliv-
ered directly.)
Communication must be tailored to each case. If Brownstein were
speaking to a venture-backed start-up with a small budget, he’d communi-
cate the lowest-cost option for his services that still provide real value.
Information would be presented in a very different way than it would be to
an established corporation with a multimillion-dollar budget that wants to
undergo a digital transformation.
It all goes back to understanding your audience and their needs. Make
sure you know whom you’re targeting, put yourself in their shoes, and ask
the right questions. This will help you provide the best service for each type
of client.

OPRAH WINFREY STARTS EVERY MEETING
WITH THESE THREE QUESTIONS
Here are the three questions Oprah Winfrey asks: “What is our inten-
tion for this meeting?” “What’s important?” and “What matters?”
Brendon Burchard, the author of High Performance Habits: How
Extraordinary People Become That Way, explains that Winfrey uses
these questions to help everyone in the room get on the same page.
The questions above help us understand how A-listers think; we
see that they’re focused and don’t want to waste time. So think about
these questions before your next important meeting, and let them
help you prepare.
THE KEY TO SURVIVAL AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS
It’s important to deliver on what you promise because it helps you main-
tain trust and credibility. If, however, for some reason you can’t deliver,
make sure you can articulate why. Strong communication between you and
your clients is essential. Understand what your clients’ communication
styles are, what type of information they like to receive, and how they like
to receive that information. Some clients want an update via phone where
you check in once a day, once a week, or once a month. Others prefer a
very detailed report with progress updates sent by email. You can also use
the Process Communication Model, outlined in chapter 4, to help you
match your clients’ or prospects’ communication styles.
Additionally, figuring out how to communicate can help you deal with
tough-to-crack clients. For example, actor Kevin Costner wasn’t interested
Standing Out as World Class . . . 245

246 HOOK POINT
in working with a trainer, but his wife encouraged him to meet with
Platinum Fitness owner Peter Park. It was one of the first times Park felt he
might fail with a client. Costner wasn’t excited about having to be at the
gym, and Park was working hard to find a Hook Point to motivate him.
Eventually, Park realized that Costner had a deep love of baseball. When
the actor came into the gym, he would see Park training a lot of profes-
sional baseball players, and he would light up. They started talking about
baseball, and Costner would get enthused by how much knowledge Park
had about his beloved sport. That was the hook that broke the barrier and
got Costner interested in Park’s experience and training. Finding this con-
nection helped them communicate. From baseball they moved on to
talking about their kids, and they’ve had a great relationship ever since.
As soon as I acquire celebrity clients—or any clients, for that matter—I
figure out who they are as people, how they like to communicate, what
they like and don’t like, and what their business-related issues are. Then I
pull all that information together and figure out a way to maintain effective
communication and a strong connection with them.
Our personal lives and businesses revolve around communication. Every
conflict and war is a result of poor communication in some sense. So, do
whatever you can to become the best possible communicator you can be in
order to create success and harmony.
YOUR JACKET DOESN’T FIT; GET IT TAILORED
Peter Park often competes with himself to see how quickly he can figure out
what type of exercise program a new client may need. These days he can
very quickly read if people are Type A and need a super-strict, challenging,

ketogenic workout, or if they require a more relaxed approach. Park is able
to go in, figure out the best solution, and deliver within the first session.
He notes that some personal trainers do the same cookie-cutter work-
outs with all their clients, which doesn’t work—this often leads to huge
client-retention issues. Instead, they should experiment and find the best
approach for each client.
One size does not usually fit all, which is why the process of testing and
learning applies to any business. If you want to acquire first-rate clients, be
adaptable, read each person as an individual, and meet his or her needs so
you can provide top-notch service to all.
KILLING IT WITH CONFIDENCE
When working with well-known clients, a lot of people psych themselves
out—they get nervous and lose their confidence. But even when Peter Park
is at Elon Musk’s house, he knows that the entrepreneur is just another guy.
Once he starts watching Musk move, Park gets into his flow and sees that
people are just people, regardless of their stature.
Park wasn’t always this levelheaded. When he worked with his first major
clients, such as Lance Armstrong, he would get very nervous. It’s taken
time and experience for him to develop 100 percent confidence. Now,
when he walks into a room, he knows that he’s good at what he does, and
his mental attitude is, “I’m going to go in and show this guy that he can’t
live without me.” His clients desire health and fitness, and he knows he can
help them achieve their goals.
It’s normal to feel insecure when first putting yourself in top-level envi-
ronments where you deal with the most successful people in the world. To
Standing Out as World Class . . . 247

better manage unproductive nerves, stay present in the moment and remain
focused on the work.
THE SKILLFUL ART OF BOUNDARIES
Sometimes celebrity clients are tough to work with. They can require a lot
of extra attention, which often makes having a lot of them on your roster
impractical. You have to set boundaries for yourself and be sure not to
overextend for specific clients, especially if they’ll be a detriment to the rest
of your business and your other clients.
Recently, I had discussions with a celebrity client who really wanted to
work with me. Based on the initial conversations with this person’s team, I
knew he would be difficult to work with. I ended up putting a huge price
tag on my services because I didn’t really want to take him on. And if I were
going to do it, I wanted enough financial compensation that it would be
worth dealing with these potential difficulties. By throwing out this huge
price for my services, the deal didn’t go through (which, again, was essen-
tially why I did it).
To provide world-class service, avoid difficult and draining people.
Personally, I don’t want to deal with that type of energy. I have private cli-
ents who pay me a lot of money, and I need to focus a lot of attention on
them to ensure they’re successful, so I’m cautious about those I decide to
work with. I always vet people to make sure they’re the right fit before
accepting them as new clients.
Don’t go after people just because they have a lot of money or because
they’re big names. Put up boundaries for you and your business so you can
maintain trust and credibility with the clients who matter. Make sure you

choose the right clients, whom you can have healthy relationships with.
Doing so will put you in the best position to provide stellar service.
WHEN WEAKNESS = SUCCESS
Know your strengths and find people who can cover for you in weak areas.
It’s critically important to have a clear understanding of what you do and
do not excel in. With this awareness, you can double down on what you’re
good at and use your energy more efficiently.
A lot of people think the contrary is true—they feel that they need to
focus on their weak areas to fill in the gaps. If it’s an area or skill that’s
crucial to your success, then go ahead and work on improving it.
Otherwise, I advise focusing on your expertise. In other words, if you’re
gifted with communication and language skills, don’t focus on math and
writing code.
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING
The most successful people are humble. They know that they don’t know
everything, so they stay hungry for knowledge. Ignorant people, on the
other hand, believe they already know everything, so they ultimately stop
learning . . . and fail. I find that whether these people are competitors or
those in a related field, I’m constantly learning from others. I enjoy talking
with people about their pricing structures, business models, and marketing
strategies—I love to understand how they approach different facets of their
work. Then I dissect what I learn and figure out how to apply this informa-
tion to improve my business model.

250 HOOK POINT
Recently, I met author and CEO Nathan Latka, a very smart and suc-
cessful entrepreneur who’s the author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller
How to Be a Capitalist Without Any Capital: The Four Rules You Must Break
to Get Rich. I had the pleasure of having breakfast with him while he broke
down his business strategies. One of the things that resonated with me was
that when he first started out, he would only present million-dollar deals to
potential clients and partners. He knew that most of those deals would be
turned down, but it taught him to feel comfortable asking for large dollar
amounts. I found this to be a really smart way to approach the business
mindset—you quickly learn how to change your self-perception about
what you’re worth as well as how to demonstrate your perceived value
to others.
By conversing with smart and savvy businesspeople, you learn how they
approach business. You don’t have to follow suit necessarily, but you can
take that information, digest it, and then determine if and how you’d like
to use it. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Let other people’s success
guide you in creating yours.

Quick Tips and Recap
1. The key to building and maintaining an impressive client roster
is knowing how to make decisions that keep you top of mind.
2. If you want access to celebrities, CEOs, or billionaires, don’t
approach them directly. Go through the trusted circle around
them, and provide value to each individual within it.

3. Before meetings with CEOs, ask yourself, “What keeps them up
at night?”
4. When in rooms with leaders of organizations, ask: “As the leader
of this company, what are your biggest priorities?” as well as
“What are your biggest concerns?”
5. If you want first-rate clients, be adaptable, read each person as
an individual, and meet their needs so you can provide top-
notch service to all.
6. If you feel insecure around high-level people, remember to stay
present and focus on the work.
7. Know your strengths, and hire people who can cover for you in
your weaker areas.
8. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Learn from other people’s
success, and let it guide you in creating yours.

CHAPTER 10
YOUR HOOK POINT IS DEAD;
LONG LIVE THE HOOK POINT
As we’ve discussed throughout this book, Hook Points are designed to help
you stand out and thrive in the 3-second world. Once you’ve identified and
perfected the Hook Point process, you need to build a solid brand founda-
tion to support the growth that comes from the attention your Hook Points
bring. If your brand is solid, you’ll be better able to harness the power of
the attention you’ll receive from effective Hook Points.
You also have to be willing to revise, test, and innovate your hooks con-
tinually (especially when attaining success). What works today may not
work in a year, a month, or even a week from now. This is because of several
factors that contribute to what I call “hook fatigue,” which I cover at the end
of this chapter. Engaging in this process is what leads to long-term success.
WHO ARE YOU?
When Nate Morley, founder of Works Collective, and one of the top brand
strategists in the United States, works with a brand to reach the next level,
he helps them answer these fundamental questions about who they are:

254 HOOK POINT
• What is our purpose?
• Why do we exist?
• What do we want to say?
• Who do we want to say it to?
• How are we different?
• What do we value?
• How do we behave?
• How are we different from other people in the space?
Morley explains that when brands answer these questions, they learn who
they are and develop a distinct point of view. He believes that lasting
growth, strength, and success do not come from knowing what you do, but
from knowing who you are as a brand; if you solely talk about what you do,
you make yourself more vulnerable to competitors and don’t allow yourself
to connect with people in a long-term, meaningful way. Morley states,
“The best brands in the world use their marketing efforts to tell people
who they are; and what they do, make, or offer becomes an expression or
proof of who they are.”
Morley states, however, that for companies who are just starting out,
there are situations where they need to talk about what they do before they
can talk about who they are. For example, photo book printing company
Chatbooks (which Morley advises) started their marketing efforts by say-
ing, “Print $6 photo books from your Instagram account.” This message
served to get the company up and running—initial users needed to know
what Chatbooks did, but eventually they had to change this message as the
company evolved and as competitors arrived to the space.
Morley posits, “Imagine if Chatbooks was still using the same messaging
two years from their inception, and another company came along and said,

Your Hook Point Is Dead; Long Live the Hook Point 255
‘Print $5 photo books from your Instagram account.’ That would put
Chatbooks in a very vulnerable position. This is inevitable in any space. At
some point a brand has to transform from talking about what they do to
talking about who [they are] to keep their customers loyal.”
Talking about who you are creates longevity. To help Chatbooks evolve
from “Print $6 photo books from your Instagram account,” Morley asked
the founders why they started the company and why they wanted to sell
photo books. By answering these fundamental questions, the founders
learned that “who they were” and “why they did it” was tied to their desire
to strengthen family connections. After discovering this, Morley developed
the messaging: “Hold On to What Matters.” Chatbooks is a great way to
allow people to hold on to what is meaningful to them—the memories, the
people, the experiences, and so on—in a completely new way. And there’s
a double meaning, in that customers can not only hold on to their memo-
ries, but they can also hold the physical photo book in their hands.
Morley explains, “Chatbooks evolved from a $6 photobook printing
company to a ‘Hold On to What Matters’ company, and eventually they
even evolved a little further—currently they talk about strengthening fam-
ilies.” Morley says that science proves that having photos of your family
ready and available creates bonds with kids, parents, grandparents, and
cousins; it actually makes family ties stronger. Chatbooks has become a
company that helps strengthen families, which can be expressed in a variety
of ways. Morley’s guidance around the difference between “what we do”
and “who we are” helped the brand evolve.
So take the time to discover who you are. It will help your company
grow and achieve lasting longevity. Your customers are loyal to who you
are, not what you do. It may take time to discover who you are, but you
won’t regret asking yourself these fundamental questions.

256 HOOK POINT
IT ISN’T EASY, BUT IT’S SIMPLE
Many people find that coming up with great Hook Points and stories is
hard. Copywriter Ernest Lupinacci says that the truth is, while it may be
hard, it’s also simple. He points out that writing a movie, climbing Mount
Everest, and completing a triathlon are in no way easy tasks, but they’re all
actually quite simple—there are a few clear steps one needs to take in order
to achieve each goal—the kicker is that completing those steps is difficult.
For example, to finish the Ironman Triathlon, you simply need to swim 2.4
miles, bike 112 miles, and run 26.2 miles. When Lupinacci explains this to
people, they usually react by saying, “That sounds hard.” To which he
replies, “I didn’t say it was easy, I said it was simple.”
Lupinacci continues, “Finding a Hook Point that stops people in their
tracks is simple. We all know what it sounds like—something likened to
the 1969 newspaper headline: “‘3:56 am: man steps on to the moon.’”
72
Recognizing a great Hook Point after the fact is easy, and the steps to cre-
ating one are simple, but actually finding a hook for your business or brand
is hard. That’s why you need to work at it every day and keep the Hook
Point Framework in your mind. As with any endeavor, it takes repetition
to become a master. Luckily, I’ve had the advantage of practicing this pro-
cess every day for the past 15 years.

RUN YOUR BRAND LIKE MARVEL RUNS ITS STUDIO
Doug Scott, former president of Ogilvy Entertainment and current presi-
dent of Big Block, believes that because we live in a world of “moments,”
where digital and social media make everything move at a faster pace,
brands often lose sight of building long-term consumer relationships, and
instead focus on short-term campaign communications. He explains that
although a lot of sales efforts are now direct to consumer, brands need to
continue to build their cultural relevance. Oftentimes people are in transit
or taking breaks from their regular activities, and during this downtime
they scroll through social media until something hooks them. Today, there
are many micro-touchpoints where you can market and sell to consum-
ers quickly. But to actually succeed in turning the attention you cap-
ture in these short windows into actual sales, you need to build strong
relationships with your customers and have consistency in your narratives
across various platforms.
Remember that brands are storytellers, no different from Marvel Studios.
Scott thinks that Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, has done an
amazing job of transmedia storytelling, saying, “Marvel and Disney have
built a meta-verse that lives across various mediums, which is critically
important to help people connect with their characters and stories. So, if
it’s a strategic tool for Marvel, why would a global brand think it’s not
important for them to ensure their messaging remains consistent and clear
across the various platforms in which they tell their stories?”
You can’t just capture someone’s attention on social media and abandon
the relationship or show something catchy that’s incongruent with the rest of
your content. Your brand needs to be structured like a movie studio. Scott
explains that products ladder up into master brand positioning just like mov-
ies within a franchise property. They drive the return on investment and the

258 HOOK POINT
quarterly earnings of your “studio,” and it should be clear that your “plush
toys” and “theme-park experiences” are part of your intellectual property and
not someone else’s. The toys are likened to your products, and the theme
park is likened to your physical store or social media content, where people
can engage with and experience what you make.
Essentially, every touchpoint must be connected, which is achieved by
understanding the role the particular medium plays in your overall narra-
tive. Scott believes that whether a person is leaning back after a long day
and watching 30-second TV spots, coming across content in their social
streams, or receiving emails, the brand’s narrative needs to be consistent
and relevant because that’s what earns permission and trust, leading to con-
sumers’ limited time and attention.
Using the tools provided in this book can help you create a strong brand
narrative, so remember to develop Hook Points and stories that are authen-
tic and provide value to your audience.
FIND YOUR MONEYBALL SOLUTION
Ernest Lupinacci explains that a major plot point in the movie Moneyball
is how for years, the scouts would pore over tons of statistics to determine
whether or not players would be good draft picks. In the movie, Jonah
Hill’s character realizes that there is ultimately only one data point that
matters, which is if players can get on first base. This is because if they can’t
do so, they can’t score runs. So as implausible as it sounds, if players can
consistently get on first, it mitigates every negative statistic they might lay
claim to—and vice versa, even if players are very good at playing certain
positions and boast all sorts of records, this won’t actually help the team if
they can’t get to first base consistently.

Your Hook Point Is Dead; Long Live the Hook Point 259
Using this analogy, Lupinacci tries to find Moneyball solutions for all his
clients. For business strategy and advertising, the Moneyball solution is the
principle that helps a company understand why they make the decisions
they do. For instance, Lupinacci posits that Apple’s success is rooted in the
belief system that “if you want to be successful, you don’t have to think
harder or more intelligently; you just have to think different.” This “think
different” principle is the Moneyball solution that theoretically helps Apple
make all of their decisions.
“Why did Apple come up with the idea of opening up their own branded
retail stores? Couldn’t they have just sold their products at Best Buy?” The
response is, “No, because they had to think different.” And if someone
asked, “Why does Apple invest so much energy and money on their design
and packaging? Once people open the boxes, don’t they just throw them
away?” The response, again driven by the Moneyball solution is, “Yeah, but
they thought different.”
Another example of a company that has historically benefited from
embracing their Moneyball solution is FedEx. Lupinacci asks, “You know
how in order to be successful in business, there are certain things that abso-
lutely, positively, have to arrive somewhere overnight?” To which most peo-
ple would reply, “Yeah, I do know that.” “And you know how a lot of
people aren’t working 40-hour workweeks anymore, they work 80-hour
workweeks, so at the end of each day there’s a lot of stuff people need to
send across the country and it absolutely has to be there overnight?” To
which, again, most people would reply, “Yes.” “Well, FedEx is the solution
to that problem.”
One could argue that over the course of the evolution of their busi-
ness, every single thing FedEx did was to ensure the packages they were
trusted with would absolutely, positively, arrive when and where they

260 HOOK POINT
promised. When FedEx makes a decision to buy extra trucks, it’s because
this helps them keep their promise. When they decided to buy Kinko’s,
it’s because this acquisition helped make it easier for them to get more
types of things to where they had to be when they needed to be there.
Every decision FedEx makes is in service to this one guiding Moneyball
principle.
In my opinion, this same analogy of the Moneyball solution can be
applied to the importance of your Hook Point. Having a great Hook Point
is the first step in your Moneyball solution because it is literally what gets
you on first base with your customers. Without it, you can’t get anyone’s
attention in order to score more runs with them. Hook Points help you
earn consumers’ time and attention so you can tell them about the stories
and beliefs that drive your business.
EMPATHY IS THE GREATEST DRIVER OF INNOVATION
Lupinacci says that when trying to come up with new ideas for Hook Points
and stories, you should keep in mind that “empathy is the greatest driver of
innovation.” As a business, you’re trying to solve people’s problems, and
oftentimes the most important ones you can solve for your customers are
mutually exclusive from your products. For example, Lupinacci explains
that the main problem Nike always sought to help address is that while
many people aspire to be athletic, not everyone felt fit enough or confident
enough to go to the gym, take a class, or play a sport. Nike’s solution is to
consistently encourage us all to “Just Do It” anyway. The brilliance of this
message is that you don’t even need to buy their products—you just need to
get out there and do whatever it is that you want to do.

Your Hook Point Is Dead; Long Live the Hook Point 261
Lupinacci adds that most of us walk (or sit) around with our personal
problems rattling about in our heads, so if—along with your Hook Points,
stories, or products—you can ask, “How can I be of assistance to you?”
instead of “Do you want to try our new XYZ?” you will better connect
with your consumers. Using empathy to anticipate and understand your
customers’ needs helps you structure your campaigns and products with
meaningfully innovative solutions. Using empathy helps you go further
and faster, and also helps you come up with better Hook Points.
INCLUSION FOR SUCCESS
John Kilcullen, the creator of the For Dummies book series, explains that
we typically hire people who are similar or familiar to us. He recommends
breaking away from this cycle and your norm. Through inclusion and
diversity of thought, geography, and point of view, you’ll arrive at greater
truths and receive breakthrough insights more quickly.
He also advises creating an environment of eustress in your business and
on your teams. Eustress is moderate psychological stress that’s beneficial for
the person experiencing it. Creating this type of environment makes peo-
ple feel like they’re thriving. They think, Wow, this is taking a lot of hours
and it’s hard work, but I feel challenged, pushed, and invigorated. Be cautious,
however, to find the balance between an environment where people feel
overly stressed, in fight-or-flight mode, and one where they feel truly pas-
sionate about their challenges.

262 HOOK POINT
THE HOOK POINT MARATHON
Endurance, follow-through, and the willingness to learn are at the core of
most people’s success. You can only fail if you give up. Maintain a strong
work ethic, and surround yourself with people who inspire and support
you—and steer away from those who tear you down and who don’t believe
in your dreams.
As you work toward your goals, also remember to stay clear about who
you are and why you do what you do. Align your Hook Points with your
personal ideals, provide value through your stories, be true to yourself, and
again, don’t give up. The more you practice the principles in this book, the
more you’ll learn, which will help you stand out quickly in the 3-second
world in which you find yourself.
HOOK FATIGUE: EVEN WHEN YOU SUCCEED, TRY, TRY AGAIN
A time will come when you find a Hook Point that helps you stand out and
scale your brand. When this happens, you’ll probably think that your work
is done—but think again—the truth is, your work in applying the Hook
Point Framework to your business has just begun. Hooks need to be
revised, tested, and innovated constantly. What works today may not work
a year, a month, or even a week from now. This is because of several factors
that contribute to what I call “hook fatigue.”
The first cause of hook fatigue is attributed to the truth in the old adage
“Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.” If you come up with an inno-
vative Hook Point, it’s inevitable that someone will eventually copy your
concept. When this happens, take it as a compliment and go back to the
drawing board, because your hook is about to become less effective.

Your Hook Point Is Dead; Long Live the Hook Point 263
Unfortunately, even if the other company does a bad job of copying your
hook, it still makes it less unique.
Earlier we discussed how other brands started copying the Toms Shoes
“one for one” Hook Point. This was a brilliant hook that worked very well,
but when other brands started implementing the concept into their cam-
paigns, it became less unique and therefore less effective. The same can be
said about Netflix’s original hook. Initially, Netflix beat out the competi-
tion, especially Blockbuster, by launching their streaming service. Today,
Hulu, Amazon, Disney, and Showtime all have their own streaming ser-
vices. The competition has forced Netflix to be innovative, which is why
they’re projected to spend $17 billion on content creation alone in 2020.

Currently, compelling Netflix original content, such as Stranger Things and
The Umbrella Academy, is Netflix’s hook.
The second reason you need to constantly evolve your Hook Points is
because regardless of whether or not other brands copy them, over time,
hooks lose their appeal. As soon as people become too familiar with your
hooks, you’re forced to innovate. The decision makers at Disneyland and
Disney World are well aware of this fact, which is why they’ve invested $1
billion to build Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge (the Star Wars–themed area inside
Disneyland and Disney World that I mentioned in chapter 1).

visitors coming to their parks. Again, I’m not suggesting that no one would
ever go back to these entertainment venues if the company never launched
a new ride again—I’m simply explaining that if Disney wants to maintain
their share of the market and attention in this 3-second world we now live
in, they have to stay relevant and create new hooks that keep people com-
ing back for more.
A NEW HOOK POINT EVERY WEEK?
The frequency with which you need to generate new Hook Points is unique
for each brand and business. Some brands can wait as long as every couple
of years, while others will need to create new hooks on a daily basis. For
example, when I was working with Katie Couric, we conducted interviews
every few days and created new Hook Points to drive people to her con-
tent, which was released nearly every day. Compared to Netflix, Nike and
many of the other larger brands don’t have to come up with hooks at that
frequency. Also, keep a close eye on your competition, because what they
do will affect the frequency with which you need to create new hooks as
well. Above all, regardless of your industry and the size of your brand, I
advise you to constantly have your next Hook Point in the back of your
mind. In our micro-attention culture, having compelling hooks at your
disposal is one of the best ways to ensure you stand out and retain/gain
market share.
However, with that said, I do have one word of caution—make sure you
evolve and develop your hooks in a way that doesn’t confuse your consum-
ers. Nike and Netflix are in a position where they can have hundreds, poten-
tially thousands of hooks, and it won’t confuse their consumers because
people are so familiar with those brands—they have a solid foundation and

brand voice that they don’t stray from when they come up with new hooks.
Other lesser-known brands don’t have that luxury. They may need to start
by focusing on one or two hooks for a duration of six months to a year to
build a solid foundation—and before they start to reach hook fatigue—
which is when they will need to work on finding new Hook Points.
THE HOOK POINT FIVE-STEP CREATION PROCESS
IS YOUR LIFE RAFT
Having an understanding of hooks and working through the Hook Point
Five-Step Creation Process often will help any company. If you build the
use of this framework into your overall business strategy, you’ll have a
one-up on competitors. Revising and examining your hooks on an ongoing
basis gives you power. Even Craig Clemens, whose copywriting has sold
more than $1 billion in products, still tests and writes copy for Golden
Hippo’s landing pages. He says, “I still write hooks, headlines, and copy
because it keeps me fresh. Testing out new ideas helps me stay innovative
and run a more successful company.”
I want you to walk away knowing that the Hook Point Framework—
and everything you’ve learned in this book—are tools that you should use
again and again. Most likely you won’t create the best hook the first time
around, and even if you do hit the jackpot right away, your successful hook
will eventually decline. To triumph in the long term, hooks need to be
constantly created, tested, and revised. Some of the smartest people I know
have achieved remarkable results through continual testing and evolution
of themselves and their brands.
Be aware that what works today may not work tomorrow, six months, or
a year from now. To make sure you stay relevant and top of mind with

266 HOOK POINT
potential consumers, instill the Hook Point Framework, and the “test,
learn, and evolve” way of thinking to your approach to business. It will
help you create the best Hook Points; and give your brand, products, and
services a better chance at long-term success. These concepts help you sur-
vive when the competition strikes, the economy takes a dip, there’s an
industry-wide issue, or when other obstacles come your way. Innovation
keeps you strong and helps you stay in the forefront of the 3-second
marketplace.
Quick Tips and Recap
1. Build a solid brand foundation to support and sustain the growth
that comes from the attention your Hook Points capture.
2. Take the time to answer the fundamental questions shared in
this chapter about who you are as a brand. It will lead to lasting
growth, success, and strength.
3. Finding a hook for your business or brand is difficult, which is
why you need to work at it every day and keep the Hook Point
Framework in mind.
4. Brands are storytellers—no different from Marvel Studios—so
treat your brand as though it is a movie studio, and keep your
messaging consistent and clear across various platforms.
5. Hook Points help you earn consumers’ time and attention so
you can tell them about the stories and beliefs that drive your
business.
6. Use empathy to understand your customers’ needs so you can
structure your campaigns with meaningfully innovative solutions.
7. Hooks need to be revised, tested, and innovated constantly.
